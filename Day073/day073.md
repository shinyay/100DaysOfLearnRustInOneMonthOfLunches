## Notes

### Traits in Rust

Traits in Rust are a way to define shared behaviors that can be implemented by different types. They define a set of methods that types implementing the trait must provide. Traits are similar to interfaces in other programming languages.

**Implementing a Trait:**
To implement a trait for a type, you use the `impl` keyword followed by the trait's name and the methods that the type should provide.

Here's a simple example:

```rust
// Define a trait named Printable
trait Printable {
    fn print(&self);
}

// Implement the Printable trait for i32
impl Printable for i32 {
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("Value: {}", self);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let num = 42;
    num.print(); // Calls the print method implemented for i32
}
```

In this example:
- We define a trait named `Printable` with a single method `print`.
- We implement the `Printable` trait for the `i32` type, providing an implementation for the `print` method.
- Inside the `main` function, we create an `i32` variable and call the `print` method on it.

**Default Implementations:**
You can also provide default implementations for trait methods, which types can use if they don't provide their own implementations. This allows you to avoid duplicating code for similar implementations.

```rust
trait Printable {
    fn print(&self) {
        println!("Default implementation");
    }
}

struct CustomType;

impl Printable for CustomType {}

fn main() {
    let custom = CustomType;
    custom.print(); // Calls the default implementation
}
```

**Using Trait Bounds:**
Trait bounds are used in function signatures to specify that a generic type must implement a certain trait. This allows you to write more generic code that works with various types that share common behavior.

```rust
fn print_trait<T: Printable>(item: T) {
    item.print();
}

fn main() {
    let num = 42;
    print_trait(num); // Calls the print method for i32
}
```

In this example, the `print_trait` function can accept any type that implements the `Printable` trait.

**Deriving Traits:**
Some traits can be automatically implemented using the `derive` attribute. For example, the `Debug` trait can be automatically implemented for types using `#[derive(Debug)]`.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStruct {
    value: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let instance = MyStruct { value: 42 };
    println!("{:?}", instance); // Automatically calls Debug implementation
}
```

This is a basic overview of trait implementation in Rust. Traits play a key role in Rust's type system, enabling code reuse, polymorphism, and generic programming while maintaining type safety.

## Key Takeaways

- **Traits Definition**: Traits in Rust define shared behaviors by specifying a set of methods that types implementing the trait must provide.

- **Implementing Traits**: To implement a trait for a type, use the `impl` keyword followed by the trait's name and the required methods.

- **Default Implementations**: Traits can include default method implementations that types can use if they don't provide their own.

- **Trait Bounds**: Trait bounds are used in function signatures to specify that a generic type must implement a certain trait.

- **Deriving Traits**: Some traits, like `Debug`, can be automatically implemented for types using the `#[derive]` attribute.

- **Code Reusability**: Traits enable code reuse by allowing multiple types to share common behavior.

- **Polymorphism**: Traits provide a way to achieve polymorphism, allowing different types to be used interchangeably when they implement the same trait.

- **Type Safety**: Trait implementation ensures type safety by defining a clear contract for methods that types must implement.
