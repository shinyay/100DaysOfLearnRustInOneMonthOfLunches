# Day 61

## Notes

`Cell`, which was **Interioe Mutability** I checked on Day 60.

The main purpose of `Cell` is to wrap a value of a Copy type and provide methods to read and write the value while avoiding Rust's usual borrowing rules.

`RefCell` is another way to change values without needing to declare `mut`.

### Interior mutability - RefCell

A mutable memory location with dynamically checked borrow rules.

  - [`pub fn replace(&self, t: T) -> T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.replace)
    - Replaces the wrapped value with a new one, returning the old value, without deinitializing either one.
  - [`pub fn replace_with<F>(&self, f: F) -> T`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.replace_with)
    - Replaces the wrapped value with a new one computed from `f`, returning the old value, without deinitializing either one.

```rust
use std::{cell::RefCell, fmt::{Display, Formatter, Result}};

// #[derive(Debug)]
// struct Book {
//     author: String,
//     title: String,
//     category: String,
//     price: u32,
//     sale: bool,
// }

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Book {
    author: String,
    title: String,
    category: String,
    price: u32,
    sale: RefCell<bool>,
}

impl Book {
    
}

impl Display for Book {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> Result {
        write!(f, "Title: {} | Price: {}", self.title, self.price)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_book = Book {
        author: "Shinya Yanagihara".to_string(),
        title: "Rust for Beginners".to_string(),
        category: "Rust".to_string(),
        price: 980,
        sale: RefCell::new(false),
    };
    println!("{:?}", my_book);

    my_book.sale.replace(true);
    println!("{:?}", my_book);

    let publication_date = 2010;
    my_book.sale.replace_with(|_| if publication_date < 2010 { true } else { false });
    println!("{:?}", my_book);

}
```

### Things about `RefCell`

In Rust, `RefCell` is a type that provides internal mutability for non-`Copy` types. It allows you to modify data even when it is accessed through an immutable (shared) reference, enforcing Rust's borrowing rules at runtime rather than compile time. This enables more flexible borrowing patterns for single-threaded scenarios.

The `RefCell<T>` type is part of the `std::cell` module in the standard library. It is commonly used when you need multiple immutable references (`&T`) and occasional mutable references (`&mut T`) to the same data. With `RefCell`, the Rust compiler performs runtime checks to ensure that borrowing rules are followed. If the rules are violated, such as having multiple mutable references at the same time, the program will panic at runtime.

Key features of `RefCell`:

1. **Interior Mutability**: `RefCell` allows you to modify the wrapped data even through an immutable reference, which is typically not allowed in Rust's borrowing rules. This is achieved by performing runtime checks at the cost of potential panics.

2. **`borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` Methods**: To access the data, you use the `borrow()` method to obtain an immutable reference (`&T`) and `borrow_mut()` to obtain a mutable reference (`&mut T`). These methods enforce borrowing rules at runtime.

3. **Runtime Panics**: If you violate the borrowing rules (e.g., having multiple mutable references), calling `borrow()` or `borrow_mut()` will result in a runtime panic.

Usage example:

```rust
use std::cell::RefCell;

fn main() {
    let data = RefCell::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);

    let shared_ref = data.borrow();
    println!("Data: {:?}", *shared_ref);

    // Uncommenting the line below will result in a panic at runtime
    // let mut_ref = data.borrow_mut();
    // mut_ref.push(4);
}
```

In this example, we create a `RefCell` wrapping a vector. We can borrow an immutable reference using `borrow()`, and everything works as expected. However, if we try to borrow a mutable reference with `borrow_mut()` while an immutable reference is active, the program will panic.

`RefCell` is a powerful tool for scenarios where you need dynamic borrowing behavior within the confines of single-threaded code. It is important to use `RefCell` judiciously and carefully handle potential panics when borrowing rules are violated. For multi-threaded environments, other synchronization primitives like `Mutex` or `RwLock` should be used to ensure thread safety.

## Key Takeaways

Key points about `RefCell`:

1. **Internal Mutability**: `RefCell` allows you to modify wrapped data through immutable references (`&T`), which would typically be disallowed by Rust's borrowing rules. This is achieved by performing runtime checks, and if rules are violated, the program will panic.

2. **`borrow()` and `borrow_mut()` Methods**: To access the data, you use `borrow()` to get an immutable reference and `borrow_mut()` for a mutable reference. These methods enforce borrowing rules at runtime and panic if violated.

3. **Single-Threaded Use**: `RefCell` is intended for single-threaded scenarios where multiple references to the same data, including mutable ones, are required with dynamic borrowing behavior.
