# Day 61

## Notes

`Cell`, which was **Interioe Mutability** I checked on Day 60.

The main purpose of `Cell` is to wrap a value of a Copy type and provide methods to read and write the value while avoiding Rust's usual borrowing rules.

`RefCell` is another way to change values without needing to declare `mut`.

### Interior mutability - RefCell

A mutable memory location with dynamically checked borrow rules.

- [`std::cell::RefCell`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html)
  - [`pub fn borrow(&self) -> Ref<'_, T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.borrow)
  - [`pub fn borrow_mut(&self) -> RefMut<'_, T>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/cell/struct.RefCell.html#method.borrow_mut)
