## Notes

### impl Trait

The `impl Trait` syntax in Rust is a way to return a value with a trait type without specifying the concrete type that implements the trait. It allows you to abstract over the actual type while providing the behavior defined by the trait. This is particularly useful when returning complex or generic types from functions.

**Basic Usage:**

Let's say you have a function that returns an iterator:

```rust
fn get_iterator() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
    vec![1, 2, 3].into_iter()
}
```

In this example, the `get_iterator` function returns an iterator without specifying the exact type of the iterator. Instead, it uses `impl Iterator<Item = i32>` to indicate that the returned value is something that implements the `Iterator` trait and produces `i32` items.

**Benefits:**

- **Abstraction**: `impl Trait` allows you to abstract over the concrete type, making your code more generic and flexible.

- **Readability**: It makes the function signature cleaner and more readable by omitting complex type names.

- **Complex Types**: It's particularly useful when working with complex types where specifying the type directly would be cumbersome.

**Limitations:**

- `impl Trait` can only be used in return positions. It's not allowed as a parameter or field type.

- You cannot directly return different types with `impl Trait` in the same function.

- It works best when the returned type is a single, concrete type that implements the trait. For more dynamic scenarios, you might still need trait objects.

**Example:**

Here's a more comprehensive example that demonstrates the use of `impl Trait`:

```rust
fn main() {
    let iterator = get_iterator();
    for num in iterator {
        println!("{}", num);
    }
}

fn get_iterator() -> impl Iterator<Item = i32> {
    vec![4, 5, 6].into_iter()
}
```

In this example, the `get_iterator` function returns an iterator without explicitly naming the type. The iterator returned can be used directly in a `for` loop or any other context where an `Iterator` is expected.

`impl Trait` is a powerful feature that simplifies code and improves readability by abstracting over the specific types while ensuring the traits' behavior. It's particularly useful when returning values from functions where the exact type is less important than the trait implementation.
