## Notes

### Regular threads and 'static guarantee

When you use regular threads (spawned using `std::thread::spawn`), you need to ensure that the data you're passing to the thread lives long enough to satisfy the `'static` lifetime requirement. This requirement is because threads can outlive the scope they were created in, and Rust's ownership system ensures that data is valid and accessible for the entire lifetime of the thread.
