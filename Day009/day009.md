# Day 9

## Notes

### Declaring variables and code blocks

```rust
fn main() {
    let this_year = 2023;
    println!("Hello, Rust in {}", this_year);
}
```

Since Rust 2021, you can write it like the following:

```rust
fn main() {
    let this_year = 2023;
    println!("Hello, Rust in {this_year}");
}
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=38f8393f0e2727ef02147223390665f0)

Variablesâ€™ lifetimes start and end inside a code block: `{}`

```rust
fn main() {
    let this_year = 2023;
    {
        let this_year = 2021;
        println!("Hello, Rust in {this_year}");
    }
    println!("Hello, Rust in {this_year}");
}
```

The following is the result:

```text
Hello, Rust in 2021
Hello, Rust in 2023
```

You can use a code block to return a value like the following:

```rust
fn main() {
    let this_year = {
        let this_year = 2021;
        this_year + 2
    };
    println!("Hello, Rust in {this_year}");
}
```

## Key Takeaways

I studied Rust in the Rust 2018 Edition books, so I actually don't know much about the 2021 Edition format.
I wanted to take this opportunity to learn about 2021 Edition and the upcoming 2024 Edition.
