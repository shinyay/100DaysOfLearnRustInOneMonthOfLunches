## Notes

**Box** is a smart pointer that's used for heap allocation. It allows you to store and manage data on the heap rather than the stack.

### Stack and Heap in Rust

1. **Stack**:
   - The stack is a region of memory that's used for storing data with a known, fixed size at compile time.
   - It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, similar to a stack of plates. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created, and when the function returns, that frame is removed.
   - Stack data is typically faster to access than heap data because of its predictable allocation and deallocation pattern.
   - Rust uses the stack for storing variables with a known, fixed size, such as integers, booleans, and function call frames.
