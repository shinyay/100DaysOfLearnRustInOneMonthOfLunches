## Notes

**Box** is a smart pointer that's used for heap allocation. It allows you to store and manage data on the heap rather than the stack.

### Stack and Heap in Rust

1. **Stack**:
   - The stack is a region of memory that's used for storing data with a known, fixed size at compile time.
   - It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) manner, similar to a stack of plates. When a function is called, a new stack frame is created, and when the function returns, that frame is removed.
   - Stack data is typically faster to access than heap data because of its predictable allocation and deallocation pattern.
   - Rust uses the stack for storing variables with a known, fixed size, such as integers, booleans, and function call frames.

2. **Heap**:
   - The heap is a region of memory used for storing data with a dynamic or unknown size at compile time. It allows for the allocation and deallocation of memory at runtime.
   - Heap data doesn't follow a strict LIFO pattern and can be allocated and deallocated in any order.
   - Accessing heap data is generally slower than stack data because it involves dereferencing pointers.
   - In Rust, the heap is used for dynamic data structures like `String`, `Vec`, and custom data types allocated with `Box`, `Rc`, or `Arc`.

#### Key Differences

- **Stack** data has a known, fixed size at compile time, while **heap** data has a dynamic or unknown size.
- **Stack** memory is automatically managed, with data being allocated and deallocated in a strict order as functions are called and return. **Heap** memory requires explicit allocation and deallocation.
- **Stack** access is faster due to its predictable nature, while **heap** access is slower due to the need to follow pointers.
- Rust's ownership system enforces strict rules for managing heap data to prevent issues like data races and memory leaks, making it safer than many other languages when dealing with heap-allocated memory.
