# Day 29

## Notes

Today I would like to use a WebAssembly development framework called **Spin** provided by **[Fermyon](https://www.fermyon.com/)**.

### Let's get started - Spin and Fermyon Cloud

- [Fermyon Cloud Introduction](https://developer.fermyon.com/cloud/index)

#### Install Spin

First, install the Spin CLI.

```shell
curl -fsSL https://developer.fermyon.com/downloads/install.sh | bash
sudo mv ./spin /usr/local/bin/spin
```

or, using `cargo` command

```shell
git clone https://github.com/fermyon/spin -b v1.3.0
cd spin
rustup target add wasm32-wasi
cargo install --locked --path .
```
