## Notes

### Arc and Mutex

Combining `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) and `Mutex` in Rust is a common approach to safely share mutable data across multiple threads. `Arc` allows multiple ownership of data, ensuring that the data is dropped only when the last reference is gone. `Mutex`, on the other hand, ensures exclusive access to data, preventing data races.

The combination of `Arc` and `Mutex` is useful when you need to share a mutable resource across multiple threads while ensuring thread safety. It's important to note that `Arc` only provides shared ownership, which means multiple threads can have read-only access to the data simultaneously. To modify the data, you need to use a `Mutex` to ensure that only one thread at a time has write access.
