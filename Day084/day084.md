## Notes

A channel in Rust is like a secure messaging system for threads. It's a way for threads to send and receive information or data in a well-organized and synchronized manner. Just as workers in a factory use a conveyor belt to move items between them safely and without chaos, Rust's channels help threads communicate and share data without causing conflicts or confusion.

### Channel basic

Imagine you have two workers (threads) in a factory, and they need to share information or items with each other. However, they can't just shout across the room, as that might lead to chaos or confusion. Instead, they need a way to pass messages or objects back and forth safely.

Channels in Rust provide a structured and organized way for threads to communicate. They work like a conveyor belt between the workers:

#### 1. **Creating a Channel:**

First, you create a channel using the `std::sync::mpsc` module (which stands for "multiple producer, single consumer"). Think of this as setting up the conveyor belt.

   ```rust
   use std::sync::mpsc;

   let (sender, receiver) = mpsc::channel();
   ```

Here, `sender` is like one worker placing items on the conveyor, and `receiver` is the other worker taking items off the conveyor.

#### 2. **Sending Data:**

In one thread (producer), you can use the `sender` to send data or messages onto the channel. This data could be anything you want to share between the threads.

   ```rust
   sender.send(1).unwrap();
   ```

In this example, we're sending the number `1` onto the channel.


#### 3. **Receiving Data:**

In the other thread (consumer), you use the `receiver` to receive the data that was sent on the channel. This is a synchronized operation, meaning the receiver will wait until data is available.

   ```rust
   let received_data = receiver.recv().unwrap();
   ```

Here, `recv()` waits for data to arrive and then retrieves it. In this case, `received_data` would be `1`.

#### 4. **Safe Communication:**

Channels handle synchronization and data transfer in a way that ensures safe communication between threads. Just like the conveyor belt ensures that items move in an orderly manner, channels ensure that data is sent and received without conflicts or race conditions.

Using channels, you can achieve coordinated communication between threads in a way that avoids issues like data races and ensures proper synchronization. This is particularly useful when you want to share data or coordinate tasks between different threads without causing chaos or confusion.

In summary, channels provide a structured and safe way for threads to communicate by passing data back and forth in a synchronized manner. Just like workers in a factory use a conveyor belt to move items without chaos, threads in Rust use channels to share data without conflicts.
