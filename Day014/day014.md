# Day 14

## Notes

### Giving references to functions

```rust
fn print_today(today: String) {
    println!("Today is {}", today);
}

fn main() {
    let today = String::from("June 14th");
    print_today(today);
    print_today(today);
}
```

When `print_today` ends, it doesn't return anything. Then the value is dead.

```text
error[E0382]: use of moved value: `today`
 --> src/main.rs:8:17
  |
6 |     let today = String::from("June 14th");
  |         ----- move occurs because `today` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
7 |     print_today(today);
  |                 ----- value moved here
8 |     print_today(today);
  |                 ^^^^^ value used here after move
```

So you can add return type as String:

```rust
fn print_today(today: String) -> String {
    println!("Today is {}", today);
    today
}

fn main() {
    let today = String::from("June 14th");
    let today = print_today(today);
    print_today(today);
}
```
