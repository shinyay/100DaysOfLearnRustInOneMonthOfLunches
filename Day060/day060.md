# Day 60

## Notes

Rust has four main ways to allow some safe mutability inside of something that is immutable: `Cell`, `RefCell`, `Mutex`, and `RwLock`.

### Interior mutability - Cell

The simples **Interior Mutability** is `Cell`, which is described as a *mutable memory location*.

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
struct Book {
    author: String,
    title: String,
    category: String,
    price: u32,
    sale: bool,
}
```
