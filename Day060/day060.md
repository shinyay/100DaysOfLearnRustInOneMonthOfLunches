# Day 60

## Notes

Rust has four main ways to allow some safe mutability inside of something that is immutable: `Cell`, `RefCell`, `Mutex`, and `RwLock`.

### Interior mutability - Cell

The simples **Interior Mutability** is `Cell`, which is described as a *mutable memory location*.

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
struct Book {
    author: String,
    title: String,
    category: String,
    price: u32,
    sale: bool,
}
```

There is an item called Sale. It is easy to imagine that this item may want to be changed at a later date.
Use `Cell` for such potentially variable fields.

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

struct Book {
    author: String,
    title: String,
    category: String,
    price: u32,
    sale: Cell<bool>,
}
```

That `Cell` holds `bool` type.

```rust
use std::{fmt::{Display, Formatter, Result}, cell::Cell};

#[derive(Debug)]
struct Book {
    author: String,
    title: String,
    category: String,
    price: u32,
    sale: Cell<bool>,
}

impl Book {
    
}

impl Display for Book {
    fn fmt(&self, f: &mut Formatter<'_>) -> Result {
        write!(f, "Title: {} | Price: {} | Sale: {}", self.title, self.price, self.sale.get())
    }
}

fn main() {
    let my_book = Book {
        author: "Shinya Yanagihara".to_string(),
        title: "Rust for Beginners".to_string(),
        category: "Rust".to_string(),
        price: 980,
        sale: Cell::new(false),
    };

    my_book.sale.set(true);

    println!("BookInfo:{}", my_book);
}
```

### What is Cell type

In Rust, the `Cell` is a part of the standard library's `core::cell` module, and it provides a way to achieve interior mutability. Interior mutability allows you to mutate data even when it is behind an immutable (shared) reference. This concept is useful when you need to modify data within a shared reference in a single-threaded environment.

The `Cell` type is typically used for simple types that implement the `Copy` trait, like integers and booleans, as it does not support types with non-trivial drop behavior or those that require dynamic memory allocation.

The main purpose of `Cell` is to wrap a value of a Copy type and provide methods to read and write the value while avoiding Rust's usual borrowing rules. The key feature of `Cell` is that it enforces atomic-like operations on the wrapped value, ensuring that the read and write operations are performed in a non-thread-safe way.

Here's a brief overview of `Cell` and its main methods:

1. **`new(value: T) -> Cell<T>`**: Creates a new `Cell` containing the given value.

2. **`get(&self) -> T`**: Returns a copy of the wrapped value.

3. **`set(&self, value: T)`**: Sets the wrapped value to the given value.

4. **`replace(&self, value: T) -> T`**: Replaces the wrapped value with a new value and returns the previous value.

5. **`into_inner(self) -> T`**: Unwraps the `Cell` and returns the inner value. This method consumes the `Cell`.

Here's a simple example demonstrating the use of `Cell`:

```rust
use std::cell::Cell;

fn main() {
    let value = Cell::new(42);

    // Reading the value
    let current_value = value.get();
    println!("Current value: {}", current_value);

    // Modifying the value
    value.set(10);

    // Replacing the value and getting the previous one
    let previous_value = value.replace(20);
    println!("Previous value: {}", previous_value);

    // Unwrapping the Cell and getting the inner value
    let unwrapped_value = value.into_inner();
    println!("Unwrapped value: {}", unwrapped_value);
}
```

Keep in mind that using `Cell` is safe for single-threaded environments, but it does not provide thread safety for concurrent operations. For concurrent programming in Rust, you'll need to use more advanced synchronization primitives like `Arc` (atomic reference counting) and `Mutex` or `RwLock` (mutex and reader-writer lock) from the `std::sync` module.
