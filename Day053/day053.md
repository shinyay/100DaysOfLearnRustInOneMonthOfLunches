# Day 53

## Notes

### Methods for closures and iterators (Cycling, zipping, folding)

- [`fn cloned<'a, T>(self) -> Cloned<Self>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.cloned)
  - Creates an iterator which clones all of its elements.
  - This is useful when you have an iterator over &T, but you need an iterator over T.
