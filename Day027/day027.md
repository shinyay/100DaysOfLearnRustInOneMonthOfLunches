# Day 27

## Notes

### References and the dot operator

When you have a reference, you need to use * to get to the value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let today = "Jun 27";
    let reference = &today;
 
   // println!("{}", today == reference);
    println!("{}", today == *reference);
}
```

If you don't put `*` in front of the value, you will get the following error:

```text
error[E0277]: can't compare `str` with `&str`

5 |     println!("{}", today == reference);
  |                          ^^ no implementation for `str == &str`
```

Now, you can take a look at the following sample. It compares the **value** with the **reference**.

```rust
fn main() {
    let today = "Jun 27".to_string();
    let another_today = "Jun 27".to_string();
    println!("{}", today == &another_today);
}
```

Of course, you can get the error:

```text
error[E0277]: can't compare `String` with `&String`

4 |     println!("{}", today == &another_today);
  |                          ^^ no implementation for `String == &String`
```

And of course, the following has the same error:

```rust
fn main() {
    let today = "Jun 27".to_string();
    let another_today = &"Jun 27".to_string();
    println!("{}", today == another_today);
}
```
