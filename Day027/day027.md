# Day 27

## Notes

### References and the dot operator

When you have a reference, you need to use * to get to the value.

```rust
fn main() {
    let today = "Jun 27";
    let reference = &today;
 
   // println!("{}", today == reference);
    println!("{}", today == *reference);
}
```

If you don't put `*` in front of the value, you will get the following error:

```text
error[E0277]: can't compare `str` with `&str`

5 |     println!("{}", today == reference);
  |                          ^^ no implementation for `str == &str`
```
