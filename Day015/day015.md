# Day 15

## Notes

### Copy types

- **Copy semantics**
- **Move semantics**

`String` isn't a Copy type.

```rust
fn print_today(today: i32) {
    println!("Today is {}", today);
}

fn main() {
    let today = 15;
    print_today(today);
    print_today(today);
}
```

In the case of `i32`, it works. It is copied.

When you use `String`, the value is *moved*.

```rust
fn print_today(today: String) {
    println!("Today is {}", today);
}

fn main() {
    let today = String::from("14");
    print_today(today);
    // print_today(today);
}
```

The following is the error.

```test
6 |     let today = String::from("14");
  |         ----- move occurs because `today` has type `String`, which does not implement the `Copy` trait
7 |     print_today(today);
  |                 ----- value moved here
8 |     print_today(today);
  |                 ^^^^^ value used here after move
```
