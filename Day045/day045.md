# Day 45

## Notes

By yesterday, I had reviewed how to implement **Trait**. And I have confirmed that it is easy to implement.
However, Rust has rules about implementation. It is called the **Orphan Rule**.

### The Orphan Rule

Here it is:

- You can implement your trait on someone else's type,
- You can implement someone else's trait on your type,
- But you can't implement someone else's trait on someone else's type.

> That's because if anyone could implement anyone's trait on anyone's type, you could never keep a single type consistent.

## Key Takeaways

People from other languages look at traits and think "Oh, this is the same as a class" or "Oh, this is the same as an interface". But traits are different and require you to sit down and think about them for a while.
