#### Sparse by default for crates.io

Cargo's "sparse" protocol is now enabled by default for reading the index from crates.io. This feature was previously stabilized with Rust 1.68.0, but still required configuration to use that with crates.io. The announced plan was to make that the default in 1.70.0.

The prior git protocol (which is still the default) clones a repository that indexes all crates available in the registry, but this has started to hit scaling limitations, with noticeable delays while updating that repository. The new protocol should provide a significant performance improvement when accessing crates.io, as it will only download information about the subset of crates that you actually use.
