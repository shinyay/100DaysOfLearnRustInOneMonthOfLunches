## Notes

`Mutex` is another way to change values without declaring `mut`. `Mutex` means “mutual exclusion”, which means “only one at a time”.

### Interior mutability - Mutex

- [`std::sync::Mutex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html)
  - A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data
  - This `mutex` will block threads waiting for the lock to become available.

This is why a Mutex is safe, because it only lets one process change it at a time. To do this, it uses .lock(). 
Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;

fn main() {
    let my_mutex = Mutex::new(10);
    let mut mutex_changer = my_mutex.lock().unwrap();

    println!("{:?}", my_mutex);
    println!("{:?}", mutex_changer);

    *mutex_changer *= 10;


    println!("my_mutex: {:?}", my_mutex);
    println!("{:?}", mutex_changer);

    let your_mutex = Mutex::new(10);
    {
        let mut mutex_changer = your_mutex.lock().unwrap();
        *mutex_changer += 1;

        println!("your_mutex: {:?}", your_mutex);
        println!("{:?}", mutex_changer);
    }

    println!("your_mutex: {:?}", your_mutex);

    let our_mutex = Mutex::new(10);
    let mut mutex_changer = our_mutex.lock().unwrap();
    *mutex_changer *= 100;
    println!("your_mutex: {:?}", our_mutex);
    drop(mutex_changer);
    println!("your_mutex: {:?}", our_mutex);
}
```

```shell
Mutex { data: <locked>, poisoned: false, .. }
10
my_mutex: Mutex { data: <locked>, poisoned: false, .. }
100
your_mutex: Mutex { data: <locked>, poisoned: false, .. }
11
your_mutex: Mutex { data: 11, poisoned: false, .. }
your_mutex: Mutex { data: <locked>, poisoned: false, .. }
your_mutex: Mutex { data: 1000, poisoned: false, .. }
```

A `Mutex` is unlocked when the `MutexGuard` goes out of scope.

### What is the `Mutex`?

In Rust, `Mutex` is a synchronization primitive that provides interior mutability, allowing multiple threads to access shared data safely. It stands for "mutual exclusion" and is a fundamental tool for concurrent programming in Rust. Mutex is part of the `std::sync` module in the standard library.

The primary purpose of `Mutex` is to enforce exclusive access to the wrapped data. It ensures that only one thread can hold the lock (mutable reference) to the data at a time, preventing data races and concurrent modifications.

Key features of `Mutex`:

1. **Interior Mutability**: `Mutex` allows you to safely mutate data even in the presence of multiple threads. It enforces exclusive access through a lock, which must be acquired before accessing the shared data.

2. **`lock()` Method**: To access the data, you need to call the `lock()` method on the `Mutex`, which returns a smart pointer called `MutexGuard`. The guard acts as a mutable reference and automatically releases the lock when it goes out of scope, ensuring that other threads can acquire the lock afterward.

3. **Blocking**: If the lock is held by another thread, the `lock()` method blocks the current thread until the lock becomes available.

Example:

```rust
use std::sync::Mutex;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Mutex::new(0);
    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Final count: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

In this example, we use `Mutex` to wrap an integer `counter`. Multiple threads increment the counter within their own scope, safely synchronized through the `Mutex`.

`Mutex` is an essential tool for concurrent programming, ensuring that shared data is accessed in a thread-safe manner. However, it introduces potential blocking, so it's crucial to use it judiciously to avoid deadlocks and performance issues. For read-heavy workloads, you might consider using `RwLock` (reader-writer lock) for shared data that can be concurrently read but requires exclusive access for modification.
