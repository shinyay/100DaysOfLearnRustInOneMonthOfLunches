## Notes

`Mutex` is another way to change values without declaring `mut`. `Mutex` means “mutual exclusion”, which means “only one at a time”.

### Interior mutability - Mutex

- [`std::sync::Mutex`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/sync/struct.Mutex.html)
  - A mutual exclusion primitive useful for protecting shared data
  - This `mutex` will block threads waiting for the lock to become available.
