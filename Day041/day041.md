## Notes

### `panic!` macro

Rust has a `panic!` macro that you can use to make it panic.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("");
}
```

```shell
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
thread 'main' panicked at 'explicit panic', src/main.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

You can show the error message with `panic!` macro:

```rust
fn prints_three_items(vector: Vec<i8>) {
    if vector.len() != 3 {
        panic!("my_vec must have 3 items, it has: {}", vector.len()) // will panic if the length is not 3
    }
    println!("{}, {}, {}", vector[0], vector[1], vector[2]);
}
 
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    prints_three_items(my_vec);
}
```

```shell
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.58s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
thread 'main' panicked at 'my_vec must have 3 items, it has: 6', src/main.rs:3:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

A convenient macro API is provided as well as `panic!`

- `assert!`:  if the part inside () is not true, the program will panic.
- `assert_eq!`: the two items inside () must be equal.
- `assert_ne!`: the two items inside () must not be equal. (ne means “not equal”)

```rust
fn prints_three_items(vector: Vec<i8>) {
    let item_count = vector.len();

    assert!(item_count == 3, "item_count should be 3, it was {item_count}");

    assert_eq!(item_count, 3, "item_count should be 3, it was {item_count}");

    assert_ne!(item_count, 4, "item_count should be 3, it was {item_count}");
}
 
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    prints_three_items(my_vec);
}
```

Let's think about `unwrap()`.

`unwrap()` is a function to extract the content of an `Option<T>` or `Result<T, E>` value (i.e., a value that wraps some other value). For example, calling 'unwrap()' on an `Option<T>` value returns the T value it contains.

Note that `unwrap()` may fail. Values of type `Option<T>`, `Result<T, E>`, etc. may or may not contain T values. If unwrap() is called without a value, the program will panic.

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
fn get_item(vector: &Vec<i32>, element_index: usize) -> i32 {
    let item = vector.get(element_index).unwrap();
    *item
}

fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];

    println!("My Vector: {:?}", my_vec);

    let item = get_item(&my_vec, 0);
    println!("1st item: {}", item);

    let item = get_item(&my_vec, 4);
    println!("5th item: {}", item);

    let item = get_item(&my_vec, 5);
    println!("6th item: {}", item);
}
```

```shell
My Vector: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
1st item: 1
5th item: 5
```

and

```shell
thread 'main' panicked at 'called `Option::unwrap()` on a `None` value', src/main.rs:2:42
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

You can see the panic when you access 6th element which is not existed. It just shows that you have access to `None`.
