## Notes

### `panic!` macro

Rust has a `panic!` macro that you can use to make it panic.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!("");
}
```

```shell
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
thread 'main' panicked at 'explicit panic', src/main.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

You can show the error message with `panic!` macro:

```rust
fn prints_three_items(vector: Vec<i8>) {
    if vector.len() != 3 {
        panic!("my_vec must have 3 items, it has: {}", vector.len()) // will panic if the length is not 3
    }
    println!("{}, {}, {}", vector[0], vector[1], vector[2]);
}
 
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
    prints_three_items(my_vec);
}
```

```shell
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 1.58s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
thread 'main' panicked at 'my_vec must have 3 items, it has: 6', src/main.rs:3:9
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
