## Notes

### `panic!` macro

Rust has a `panic!` macro that you can use to make it panic.

```rust
fn main() {
    panic!();
}
```

```shell
   Compiling playground v0.0.1 (/playground)
    Finished dev [unoptimized + debuginfo] target(s) in 0.58s
     Running `target/debug/playground`
thread 'main' panicked at 'explicit panic', src/main.rs:2:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```
