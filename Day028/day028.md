# Day 28

## Notes

Today I begin Chapter 5, Generics, Option, and Result.

- **Generics** - When you want to use more than one type
- **Option** - When an operation might produce a value, but maybe not
- **Result** - When an operation might succeed, but maybe not

### Generics

Before thinking of Generics, let's take a look at the following sample:

```rust
fn return_doubled_number(number: u8) -> u8 {
    println!("Here is your number: {}", number);
    number * 2
    
}
fn main() {
    let number = return_doubled_number(10);
    println!("Doubled number: {number}");
}
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=6c6fdb864af121d46f6e2be9103ef279)

Now, what we need to consider is that it takes `u8` as a parameter and returns `u8` as a return value.
That is, the minimum value is `0` and the maximum value is `255`. What about the cases where the value is in a range other than this?

For example, `let number = return_doubled_number(128);`:

```shell
thread 'main' panicked at 'attempt to multiply with overflow', src/main.rs:3:5
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

In other words, it needs to be able to accommodate a variety of types.

For **Generics**, you use angle brackets with the type inside, like this: **`<T>`**

```rust
fn return_number<T>(number: T) -> T {
    println!("Here is your number.");
    number
}
fn main() {
    let number = return_number(5);
}
```
