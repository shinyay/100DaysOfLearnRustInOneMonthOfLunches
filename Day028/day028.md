# Day 28

## Notes

Today I begin Chapter 5, Generics, Option, and Result.

- **Generics** - When you want to use more than one type
- **Option** - When an operation might produce a value, but maybe not
- **Result** - When an operation might succeed, but maybe not

### Generics

Before thinking of Generics, let's take a look at the following sample:

```rust
fn return_doubled_number(number: u8) -> u8 {
    println!("Here is your number: {}", number);
    number * 2
    
}
fn main() {
    let number = return_doubled_number(10);
    println!("Doubled number: {number}");
}
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=6c6fdb864af121d46f6e2be9103ef279)


For **Generics**, you use angle brackets with the type inside, like this: **`<T>`**

```rust
fn return_number<T>(number: T) -> T {
    println!("Here is your number.");
    number
}
fn main() {
    let number = return_number(5);
}
```
