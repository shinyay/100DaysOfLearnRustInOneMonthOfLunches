# Day 28

## Notes

Today I begin Chapter 5, Generics, Option, and Result.

- **Generics** - When you want to use more than one type
- **Option** - When an operation might produce a value, but maybe not
- **Result** - When an operation might succeed, but maybe not

### Generics

For **Generics**, you use angle brackets with the type inside, like this: **`<T>`**
