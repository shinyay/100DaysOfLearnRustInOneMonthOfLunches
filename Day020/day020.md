## Notes

### Collection types - Tuples

Tuples in Rust use **`()`**.

**Tuples** can hold many things, and can hold different types too. Items inside a tuple are also indexed with numbers 0, 1, 2, and so on. But to access them, you use a `.` instead of a `[]`. 

```rust
fn main() {
    let various_tuple = ("Tuple", 1, 'a', vec!["Collections", "Vector"], [2, 3, 5]);
    
    println!("1st element: {:?}", various_tuple.0);
    println!("2nd element: {:?}", various_tuple.1);
    println!("3rd element: {:?}", various_tuple.2);
    println!("4th element: {:?}", various_tuple.3);
    println!("4th element: {:?}", various_tuple.3[1]);
    println!("5th element: {:?}", various_tuple.4);
    println!("5th element: {:?}", various_tuple.4[0]);
}
```
