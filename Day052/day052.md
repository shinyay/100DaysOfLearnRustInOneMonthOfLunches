# Day 52

## Notes

- [std::iter::Iterator](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html)

### Methods for closures and iterators (Cycling, zipping, folding)

- [`fn zip<U>(self, other: U) -> Zip<Self, <U as IntoIterator>::IntoIter>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/iter/fn.zip.html)
  - ‘Zips up’ two iterators into a single iterator of pairs.
  - `zip()`` returns a new iterator that will iterate over two other iterators, returning a tuple where the first element comes from the first iterator, and the second element comes from the second iterator.

- [`fn cycle(self) -> Cycle<Self>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.cycle)
  - Repeats an iterator endlessly.

```rust
fn main() {
    let even_odd_vec = vec!["even", "odd"];

    let my_vec = (0..10)
        .zip(even_odd_vec.into_iter().cycle())
        .collect::<Vec<(i32, &str)>>();

    println!("{:?}", my_vec);
}
```

- [`fn fold<B, F>(self, init: B, f: F) -> B`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.fold)
  - Folds every element into an accumulator by applying an operation, returning the final result.
  - `fold()` takes two arguments: an initial value, and a closure with two arguments: an ‘accumulator’, and an element. The closure returns the value that the accumulator should have for the next iteration.

```rust
fn main() {
    let some_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
 
    println!("{}", some_numbers
        .iter()
        .fold(0, |total_so_far, next_number| total_so_far + next_number)
    );
}
```

- [`fn take_while<P>(self, predicate: P) -> TakeWhile<Self, P>`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.take_while)
  - Creates an iterator that yields elements based on a predicate.
  - `take_while()` takes a closure as an argument. It will call this closure on each element of the iterator, and yield elements while it returns true.
  - After `false` is returned, `take_while()`’s job is over, and the rest of the elements are ignored.


```rust
fn main() {
    let a = [-1, 0, 1];
    let mut result = a.iter().take_while(|x| **x < 0);
    println!("{:?}", result.next());
    println!("{:?}", result.next());
}
```

```shell
Some(-1)
None
```

## Key Takeaways

I cheked the methods related to Iterator today too.
