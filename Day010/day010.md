# Day 10

## Notes

### Display and Debug

```rust
fn main() {
    let doesnt_print = ();
    // println!("This will not print: {}", doesnt_print);

    println!("This will print with {{:?}} : {:?}", doesnt_print);

    println!("This will pretty-print {{:#?}} : {:#?}", doesnt_print);
}
```

- `{}` : Display print. More types have Debug than Display, so if a type you want to print can't print with Display, you can try this:
- `{:?}` : Debug print. And if there is too much information on one line, you can try this:
- `{:#?}` : Debug print, but pretty. 'Pretty' means that each part of a type is printed on its own line to make it easier to read.
