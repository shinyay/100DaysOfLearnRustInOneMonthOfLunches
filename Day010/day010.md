# Day 10

## Notes

### Display and Debug

```rust
fn main() {
    let doesnt_print = ();
    // println!("This will not print: {}", doesnt_print);

    println!("This will print with {{:?}} : {:?}", doesnt_print);

    println!("This will pretty-print {{:#?}} : {:#?}", doesnt_print);
}
```

- `{}` : **Display print**
- `{:?}` : **Debug print**
- `{:#?}` : **Debug pretty-print** ('Pretty' means that each part of a type is printed on its own line to make it easier to read.)
