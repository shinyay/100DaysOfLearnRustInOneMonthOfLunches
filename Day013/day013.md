## Notes

### References

The relationship between reference and lifetime is important.

The folloing `return_str` function is to return a reference to the `String`.

```rust
fn return_str() -> &String {
    let some_string = String::from("String");
    let string_ref = &some_string;
    string_ref // When this function ends, the reference also ends since some_string lives during this function.
}
fn main() {
    let some_string = return_str();
}
```
