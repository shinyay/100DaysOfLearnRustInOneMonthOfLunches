## Notes

### Closures as arguments

The following function signature shows that **it takes a closure**, **takes by value** (`FnOnce` = **takes by value**), and doesn't return anything. So now we can call this closure that takes nothing and write whatever we like inside it.

Take a look at the following function. My function defines like the following:

- `fn my_function_fnonce<F>(f: F) where F: FnOnce() { f(); }`
  - `(f: F)` shows that parameter is **Closure**
  - `F: FnOnce()` shows that the closure implements `FnOnce`

```rust
fn my_function_fnonce<F>(f: F)
where
    F: FnOnce(),
{
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    my_function_fnonce(|| {
        my_vec
            .into_iter()
            .for_each(|x| println!("Count: {x}"));
    });
}
```

This clousure implements `FnOnce`, so it takes by value. Therefore you can't call it with `my_vec`.
If you want to take teke by reference, the closure shoudle be implementes with `Fn`

```rust
fn my_function_fn<F>(f: F)
where
    F: Fn(),
{
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    my_function_fn(|| {
        my_vec
            .iter()
            .for_each(|x| println!("Count: {x}"));
    });
    my_function_fn(|| {
        my_vec
            .iter()
            .for_each(|x| println!("Doubled: {}", x*2));
    });
}
```

Let us look again at examples of the use of the three types of closures:

```rust
fn my_function_fnonce<F: FnOnce()>(f: F) {
    print!("[my_function_fnonce]");
    f();
}

fn my_function_fnmut<F: FnMut()>(mut f: F) {
    print!("[my_function_fnmut]");
    f();
    print!("[my_function_fnmut]");
    f();
}

fn my_function_fn<F: Fn()>(f: F) {
    print!("[my_function_fn]");
    f();
    print!("[my_function_fn]");
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let mut my_string = "Hello Closure".to_string();
    
    let my_closure_fn = || {
        println!("{}", my_string);
    };
    my_closure_fn();
    my_function_fn(my_closure_fn);

    let mut my_closure_fnmut = || {
        my_string.push_str(" in Rust");
        println!("{}", my_string);
    };
    my_closure_fnmut();
    my_function_fnmut(my_closure_fnmut);

    let my_closure_drop = || {
        println!("Dropping: {}", my_string);
        drop(my_string);
    };
    // my_closure_drop();
    my_function_fnonce(my_closure_drop);
}
```

### Trait for Fn, FnMut and FnOnce

- [std::ops::Fn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.Fn.html)

```rust
pub trait Fn<Args>: FnMut<Args>
```

This declaration means that a closure needs to implement `FnMut` before it can implement `Fn`.

Take a look at the `FnMut`

- [std::ops::FnMut](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnMut.html)

```rust
pub trait FnMut<Args>: FnOnce<Args>
```

This means that a closure needs to implement `FnOnce` before it can implement `FnMut`.

Finally take a look at the `FnOnce`

- [std::ops::FnOnce](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/ops/trait.FnOnce.html)

```rust
pub trait FnOnce<Args>
```

`FnOnce` doesn't need any other traits to be implemented first.

## Key Takeaways

The features and differences among `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` related closures in Rust:

1. **`Fn` Closures**:
   - **Feature**: Closures implementing the `Fn` trait can capture variables by reference and can't modify the captured variables. They are suitable for situations where you only need to read the captured variables within the closure.
   - **Usage**: Use `Fn` closures when you want to use the captured variables in a read-only manner.
   - **Example**:
     ```rust
     let x = 42;
     let fn_closure = || {
         println!("Fn closure: x = {}", x);
     };
     ```

2. **`FnMut` Closures**:
   - **Feature**: Closures implementing the `FnMut` trait can capture variables by mutable reference and modify the captured variables. They are used when you need to modify the captured variables within the closure.
   - **Usage**: Use `FnMut` closures when you want to both read and modify the captured variables.
   - **Example**:
     ```rust
     let mut x = 42;
     let fn_mut_closure = || {
         x += 1;
         println!("FnMut closure: x = {}", x);
     };
     ```

3. **`FnOnce` Closures**:
   - **Feature**: Closures implementing the `FnOnce` trait can capture variables by value, effectively taking ownership of the captured variables. They can only be called once because they consume the captured variables.
   - **Usage**: Use `FnOnce` closures when you want to take ownership of the captured variables, often used when moving them into the closure.
   - **Example**:
     ```rust
     let x = 42;
     let fn_once_closure = move || {
         println!("FnOnce closure: x = {}", x);
     };
     ```

The choice among these closure traits depends on the level of access you need to the captured variables and whether you want to read, modify, or consume them.

In addition to these differences, it's important to remember that the type of closure you create can affect how they interact with variables and ownership, as well as how they behave in different contexts. The `move` keyword can be used to modify the capture behavior and turn closures into `FnOnce` closures when necessary.

Using the appropriate closure trait ensures that your code behaves as expected while maintaining the balance between readability, mutability, and ownership semantics.
