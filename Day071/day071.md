## Notes

### Closures as arguments

The following function signature shows that **it takes a closure**, **takes by value** (`FnOnce` = **takes by value**), and doesn't return anything. So now we can call this closure that takes nothing and write whatever we like inside it.

Take a look at the following function. My function defines like the following:

- `fn my_function_fnonce<F>(f: F) where F: FnOnce() { f(); }`
  - `(f: F)` shows that parameter is **Closure**
  - `F: FnOnce()` shows that the closure implements `FnOnce`

```rust
fn my_function_fnonce<F>(f: F)
where
    F: FnOnce(),
{
    f();
}

fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
    my_function_fnonce(|| {
        my_vec
            .into_iter()
            .for_each(|x| println!("Count: {x}"));
    });
}
```
