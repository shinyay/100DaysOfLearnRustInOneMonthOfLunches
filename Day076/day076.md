## Notes

Dealing with Rust's impl Trait, I felt it was similar to Java's polymorphism. So, I think about the similarities and differences between the two.

### `impl Trait` in Rust vs Polymorphism in Java

While there are similarities between the use of `impl Trait` in Rust and certain aspects of polymorphism in languages like Java, there are also important differences due to Rust's focus on static dispatch and type safety.

**Similarities:**

1. **Abstraction and Interface**: Both `impl Trait` in Rust and polymorphism in Java aim to provide an abstraction over concrete types. They allow you to work with objects of different types through a common interface without needing to know their exact implementation.

2. **Reduced Coupling**: In both cases, using abstractions like `impl Trait` or interfaces in Java reduces the coupling between different parts of your code, making it more modular and maintainable.

**Differences:**

1. **Static Dispatch**: One key difference is in how the abstraction is implemented. Rust emphasizes static dispatch, meaning the actual function implementation is resolved at compile time based on the types involved. In Java, polymorphism often involves dynamic dispatch, where the method to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual object's type.

2. **Trait Objects vs. `impl Trait`**: In Rust, trait objects provide a form of dynamic dispatch, allowing you to work with different concrete types implementing a common trait, similar to Java's polymorphism. However, `impl Trait` is used for returning specific, statically dispatched types without exposing the concrete types. It's more aligned with Rust's focus on avoiding unnecessary runtime overhead.

3. **Type Safety**: Rust's approach, including `impl Trait`, maintains Rust's strong type safety, ensuring that the compiler enforces trait implementations and prevents potential issues.

4. **Performance and Ownership**: Rust's design considers performance and ownership. `impl Trait` generally avoids some of the runtime overhead associated with dynamic dispatch in languages like Java, providing a balance between abstraction and performance.

In summary, while both `impl Trait` in Rust and polymorphism in Java share the idea of abstraction over concrete types, Rust's emphasis on static dispatch, ownership, and type safety leads to some distinctions in how they are implemented and used.
