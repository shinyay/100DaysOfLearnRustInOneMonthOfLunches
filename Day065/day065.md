## Notes

### The `todo!` macro

In Rust, the `todo!` macro is a placeholder that's used to indicate unfinished or incomplete code. It's a helpful tool during development to mark areas of code that you intend to implement later. When the code containing `todo!` is executed, it will panic and display a message indicating that the specific functionality is yet to be implemented.

Take a look at the following code. which has some errors.

```rust
struct Book {}

enum BookCategory {
    Mistery,
    Fantasy,
    Action,
    Technology,
}
 
fn get_book(book: &Book) -> Option<String> {} 

fn delete_book(book: &Book) -> Result<(), String> {} 

fn check_book_category(book_category: &BookCategory) {
    match book_category {
        BookCategory::Action => println!("The Category is Action"),
        BookCategory::Fantasy => println!("The Category is Fantasy"),
        BookCategory::Mistery => println!("The Category is Mistery"),
        BookCategory::Technology => println!("The Category is Technology"),
    }
}
 
fn main() {
    let book_category = BookCategory::Technology;
    check_book_category(&book_category);
}

```

The erros show as the following:

```shell
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:10:29
   |
10 | fn get_book(book: &Book) -> Option<String> {} 
   |    --------                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `Option<String>`, found `()`
   |    |
   |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
   |
   = note:   expected enum `Option<String>`
           found unit type `()`

error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:12:32
   |
12 | fn delete_book(book: &Book) -> Result<(), String> {} 
   |    -----------                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `Result<(), String>`, found `()`
   |    |
   |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
   |
   = note:   expected enum `Result<(), String>`
           found unit type `()`
```

Both `get_book()` and `delete_book()` specify a return type, but do not implement the return value in the body of the function. This is why such an error occurs.
However, we may want to predefine only the function signature and implement it later.

This is where you can use `todo!()`. If you add it to the function, Rust will not complain, and will compile.

There are other ways to use the `todo!` macro.

Take a look at the following sample code and the error:

```rust
struct Book {
    name: String,
    author: String,
    price: u32,
}

fn register_book() -> Book {
    Book {
        name: (),
        author: (),
        price: ()
    }
}
 
fn main() {}
```

```shell
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:9:15
  |
9 |         name: (),
  |               ^^ expected `String`, found `()`

error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:10:17
   |
10 |         author: (),
   |                 ^^ expected `String`, found `()`

error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:11:16
   |
11 |         price: ()
   |                ^^ expected `u32`, found `()`
```

Then you can use `todo!` macro as the following:

```rust
struct Book {
    name: String,
    author: String,
    price: u32,
}

fn register_book() -> Book {
    Book {
        name: todo!(),
        author: todo!(),
        price: todo!()
    }
}
 
fn main() {}
```

## Key Takeaways

The `todo!` macro is often used as a reminder to the developer that certain parts of the codebase need attention. It helps prevent accidentally shipping incomplete features or forgetting to implement certain aspects of the program.

Here's how you can use the `todo!` macro:

```rust
fn main() {
    // This line will cause a panic with a message indicating the code is unfinished
    let result = todo!("Implement this functionality");
    
    println!("Result: {:?}", result);
}
```

When you run this code, it will panic with a message like this:

```
thread 'main' panicked at 'not yet implemented: Implement this functionality', src/main.rs:4:19
note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
```

The `todo!` macro is helpful for indicating areas that need further work, and it's especially useful in collaborative projects or situations where you're incrementally developing a feature. Just remember to replace the `todo!` statements with actual code as you proceed with development.
