## Notes

### The `todo!` macro

In Rust, the `todo!` macro is a placeholder that's used to indicate unfinished or incomplete code. It's a helpful tool during development to mark areas of code that you intend to implement later. When the code containing `todo!` is executed, it will panic and display a message indicating that the specific functionality is yet to be implemented.

Take a look at the following code. which has some errors.

```rust
struct Book {}

enum BookCategory {
    Mistery,
    Fantasy,
    Action,
    Technology,
}
 
fn get_book(book: &Book) -> Option<String> {} 

fn delete_book(book: &Book) -> Result<(), String> {} 

fn check_book_category(book_category: &BookCategory) {
    match book_category {
        BookCategory::Action => println!("The Category is Action"),
        BookCategory::Fantasy => println!("The Category is Fantasy"),
        BookCategory::Mistery => println!("The Category is Mistery"),
        BookCategory::Technology => println!("The Category is Technology"),
    }
}
 
fn main() {
    let book_category = BookCategory::Technology;
    check_book_category(&book_category);
}

```

The erros show as the following:

```shell
error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:10:29
   |
10 | fn get_book(book: &Book) -> Option<String> {} 
   |    --------                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `Option<String>`, found `()`
   |    |
   |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
   |
   = note:   expected enum `Option<String>`
           found unit type `()`

error[E0308]: mismatched types
  --> src/main.rs:12:32
   |
12 | fn delete_book(book: &Book) -> Result<(), String> {} 
   |    -----------                 ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ expected `Result<(), String>`, found `()`
   |    |
   |    implicitly returns `()` as its body has no tail or `return` expression
   |
   = note:   expected enum `Result<(), String>`
           found unit type `()`
```

Both `get_book()` and `delete_book()` specify a return type, but do not implement the return value in the body of the function. This is why such an error occurs.
However, we may want to predefine only the function signature and implement it later.

This is where you can use `todo!()`. If you add it to the function, Rust will not complain, and will compile.
