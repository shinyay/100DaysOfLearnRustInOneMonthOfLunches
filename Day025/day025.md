# Day 25

## Notes

### Implementing structs and enums

- `impl`: To call functions on a struct or an enum
  - The function is called **Method**

**Methods** have two kinds:

- **Methods**
- **Associated Functions**

#### Methods

The method take `self` (`&self` or `&mut self` or `self`)

The method uses `.` when you call it.
ex: `something.doSomething()`

#### Associated Functions

The method does not take `self`.
The medhod is known as *static method* in some other languages.

The method uses `::` when you call it.
ex: `String::from()` and `Vec::new()`

**associated** means **related to**.

#### The sample of Structs and Enmus

If you want to print `struct` and `enmu` with `{:?}`, you add `#[derive(Debug)]` **attribute** above struct and enum.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Human {
    age: u32.
    gender: Gender,
}

#[derive(Debug)]
enmu Gender {
    Male,
    Female,
    Other,
}

impl Human {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Self {
            age: 30,
            gender: Gender::Male,
        }
    }
}

```
