# Day 6

## Notes

### Rust Changelogs - 1.69.0 (20 April, 2023)

The version I was using before I went to `1.70.0` was `1.67.0`, so I would like to see what has been released in the period between updates.

- [Rust Changelogs - 1.69.0 (20 April, 2023)](https://releases.rs/docs/1.69.0/)
- [Announcing Rust 1.69.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/04/20/Rust-1.69.0.html)

#### Cargo now suggests to automatically fix some warnings

- [feat: stabilize auto fix note](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11558/)

Cargo suggests running `cargo fix` or `cargo clippy --fix` when it detects warnings that are automatically fixable.

#### Debug information is not included in build scripts by default anymore

To improve compilation speed, Cargo now avoids emitting debug information in build scripts by default. There will be no visible effect when build scripts execute successfully, but backtraces in build scripts will contain less information.

If you want to debug a build script, you can add this snippet to your Cargo.toml to emit debug information again:

```text
[profile.dev.build-override]
debug = true
[profile.release.build-override]
debug = true
```
