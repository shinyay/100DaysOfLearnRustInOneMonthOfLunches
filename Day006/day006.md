# Day 6

## Notes

### Rust Changelogs - 1.69.0 (20 April, 2023)

The version I was using before I went to `1.70.0` was `1.67.0`, so I would like to see what has been released in the period between updates.

- [Rust Changelogs - 1.69.0 (20 April, 2023)](https://releases.rs/docs/1.69.0/)
- [Announcing Rust 1.69.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/04/20/Rust-1.69.0.html)

#### Cargo now suggests to automatically fix some warnings

- [feat: stabilize auto fix note](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11558/)

Cargo suggests running `cargo fix` or `cargo clippy --fix` when it detects warnings that are automatically fixable.
