## Notes

Closures are like quick functions that **don't need a name**.
They use `||` instead of `()`. 

### Closures

Take a look at this, which the simplest sample for the Closure:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_closure = || println!("Hello, Closure!");
    my_closure();
}
```

The point is `||`.
The `||` can have the input variable and type, like `()` for a function:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_closure = |x: &str| println!("Hello, {x}!");
    my_closure("Closure");
    my_closure("Rust");
    my_closure("Shinya");
}
```

In addition to it, `||` can includes **"Code Block**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_closure = |x: i32| {
        let multiplier = 10;
        let devider = 2;

        println!("Calc1: {} x {} = {}", x, multiplier, x * multiplier);
        println!("Calc2: {} / {} = {}", x, devider, x / devider);
    };
    
    my_closure(10);
    my_closure(2);
}
```
