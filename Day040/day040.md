# Day 40

## Notes

### The ? operator (question mark operator)

There is an even shorter way to deal with `Result` (and `Option`), shorter than match and even shorter than if let.

- [Option](https://github.com/shinyay/100DaysOfLearnRustInOneMonthOfLunches/blob/main/Day030/day030.md)
- [Result](https://github.com/shinyay/100DaysOfLearnRustInOneMonthOfLunches/blob/main/Day031/day031.md)

The question mark operator (`?`) unwraps valid values or returns errornous values, propagating them to the calling function. It is a unary postfix operator that can only be applied to the types `Result<T, E>` and `Option<T>`.

```rust
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn main() -> Result<(), ParseIntError>
{
    // let num = "7".parse::<i32>()?;
    let num = "7.0".parse::<i32>()?;
    println!("{:?}", num);
    Ok(())
}
```

```shell
use std::num::ParseIntError;

fn main() -> Result<(), ParseIntError>
{
    // let num = "7".parse::<i32>()?;
    let num = "7.0".parse::<i32>()?;
    println!("{:?}", num);
    Ok(())
}
```

### VecDeque

In `Vec`, when an element is deleted, the element shifts to the left to fill the deleted index.
Then, as you can imagine, it takes time.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec = vec![0; 600_000];
    for i in 0..600000 {
        my_vec.remove(0);
    }
}
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=ff058f33ff7efe0be2e2499d674277c4)

Rust Playground causes a timeout:

```shell
/playground/tools/entrypoint.sh: line 15:     8 Killed                  timeout --signal=KILL ${timeout} "$@"
```

`VecDeque`  uses something called a **ring buffer** to make this possible

```rust
use std::collections::VecDeque;
 
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec = VecDeque::from(vec![0; 600000]);
    for i in 0..600000 {
        my_vec.pop_front(); // pop_front is like .pop but for the front
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

The question mark operator is very useful. When I first saw it, I thought it was a ternary operator, but it is very good because it simplifies the syntax by eliminating the use of if statements and matches to determine the Result.
