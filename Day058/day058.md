# Day 58

## Notes

### Lifetime annotations

`'static`` indicates that the data pointed to by the reference lives for the entire lifetime of the running program.

Now take a look at the following sample:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: & 'static str,
    age: u32,
}
 
fn main() {
    let people_vec = vec!["Yanagihara".to_string(), "John".to_string()];

    let me = Person {
        name: &people_vec[0],
        age: 30,
    };

    println!("{:?}", me);
}
```

And take a look at the following error:

```shell
error[E0597]: `people_vec` does not live long enough
  --> src/main.rs:11:16
   |
8  |     let people_vec = vec!["Yanagihara".to_string(), "John".to_string()];
   |         ---------- binding `people_vec` declared here
...
11 |         name: &people_vec[0],
   |               -^^^^^^^^^^---
   |               ||
   |               |borrowed value does not live long enough
   |               this usage requires that `people_vec` is borrowed for `'static`
...
16 | }
   | - `people_vec` dropped here while still borrowed
```

Instead of `'static`, I'll use `'a` here:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person<'a> {
    name: &'a str,
    age: u32,
}
 
fn main() {
    let people_vec = vec!["Yanagihara".to_string(), "John".to_string()];

    let me = Person {
        name: &people_vec[0],
        age: 30,
    };

    println!("{:?}", me);
}
```

Now it works.

## Key Takeaways

Rust has a **lifetime** on all references.
To explicitly specify a lifetime, you must use a lifetime parameter, such as `'a`.

However, it is time-consuming to write lifetime parameters for all references,
Therefore, the lifetime is inferred according to certain rules, and those outside the rules are compiled as errors.

Elision rules are as follows:

- Each elided lifetime in input position becomes a distinct lifetime parameter.

- If there is exactly one input lifetime position (elided or not), that lifetime is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.

- If there are multiple input lifetime positions, but one of them is &self or &mut self, the lifetime of self is assigned to all elided output lifetimes.

- Otherwise, it is an error to elide an output lifetime.
