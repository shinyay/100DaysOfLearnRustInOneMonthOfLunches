# Day 31

## Notes

**Result** - When an operation might succeed, but maybe not

### Result

`Result` is similar to `Option`

- `Option`
  - There might be something
    - `Some`: Value
    - `None`: No Value
- `Result`
  - It might be fail
    - `Ok`: Okay Result
    - `Err`: Error Result

Take a look at the following sample. u8 integer divided by 2. If you put the odd number, the program does not occur `panic`.
`Result` helps it.

```rust
fn even_number_day(today: u8) -> Result<(), ()> {
    if today % 2 == 0 {
        return Ok(())
    } else {
        return Err(())
    }
}
 
fn main() {
    let today = 3;
    let result = even_number_day(today);
    if result.is_ok() {
        println!("Yes, today is {}", today)
    } else {
        println!("No, today is not {}", today)
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

As I mentioned at the beginning of this article, I have confirmed that Option and Result are very similar.

- **`Option`** (`Some` / `None`) is used when it is not known whether a value will be returned
- **`Result`** (`Ok` / `Err`) is used when it is not known whether the operation will succeed or not
