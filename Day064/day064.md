## Notes

### Importing and renaming inside a function

Like Java and many other programming languages, Rust allows for importing in namespaces.

```rust
enum Month {
    January,
    February,
    March,
    April,
    May,
    June,
    July,
    August,
    September,
    October,
    November,
    December,
}

fn select_month(month: &Month) {
    match month {
        Month::January => println!("It's Winter."),
        Month::February => println!("It's Winter."),
        Month::March => println!("It's Spring."),
        Month::April => println!("It's Spring."),
        Month::May => println!("It's Spring."),
        Month::June => println!("It's Summer."),
        Month::July => println!("It's Summer."),
        Month::August => println!("It's Summer."),
        Month::September => println!("It's Fall."),
        Month::October => println!("It's Fall."),
        Month::November => println!("It's Fall."),
        Month::December => println!("It's Winter."),
        _ => println!("Etc."),
    }
}

fn select_month_refined(month: &Month) {
    use Month::*;

    let winter = "Winter";
    let spring = "Spring";
    let summer = "Summer";
    let fall = "Fall";

    match month {
        January => println!("{winter}"),
        February => println!("{winter}"),
        March => println!("{spring}"),
        _ => println!("Etc."),
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let month = Month::January;
    select_month(&month);

    let month = Month::March;
    select_month_refined(&month);
}
```

In the above sample, `select_month(month: &Month)`, the enum names are redundant.
On the other hand, `fn select_month_refined(month: &Month)` it uses `use Month::*`.

`::*` means "import everything after the `::`".
