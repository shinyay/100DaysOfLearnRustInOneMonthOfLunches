## Notes

### Importing and renaming inside a function

Like Java and many other programming languages, Rust allows for importing in namespaces.

```rust
enum Month {
    January,
    February,
    March,
    April,
    May,
    June,
    July,
    August,
    September,
    October,
    November,
    December,
}

fn select_month(month: &Month) {
    match month {
        Month::January => println!("It's Winter."),
        Month::February => println!("It's Winter."),
        Month::March => println!("It's Spring."),
        Month::April => println!("It's Spring."),
        Month::May => println!("It's Spring."),
        Month::June => println!("It's Summer."),
        Month::July => println!("It's Summer."),
        Month::August => println!("It's Summer."),
        Month::September => println!("It's Fall."),
        Month::October => println!("It's Fall."),
        Month::November => println!("It's Fall."),
        Month::December => println!("It's Winter."),
        _ => println!("Etc."),
    }
}

fn select_month_refined(month: &Month) {
    use Month::*;

    let winter = "Winter";
    let spring = "Spring";
    let summer = "Summer";
    let fall = "Fall";

    match month {
        January => println!("{winter}"),
        February => println!("{winter}"),
        March => println!("{spring}"),
        _ => println!("Etc."),
        
    }
}

fn main() {
    let month = Month::January;
    select_month(&month);

    let month = Month::March;
    select_month_refined(&month);
}
```

In the above sample, `select_month(month: &Month)`, the enum names are redundant.
On the other hand, `fn select_month_refined(month: &Month)` it uses `use Month::*`.

`::*` means "import everything after the `::`".

However, there may be others that use the same namespace.
So, I think there is an aversion to importing everything.

It is therefore possible to use an alias.

```rust
fn select_month_abbreviation(month: &Month) {
    use Month::{
        January as JAN,
        February as FEB,
        March as MAR,
        April as APR,
        May as MAY,
        June as JUN,
        July as JUL,
        August as AUG,
        September as SEP,
        October as OCT,
        November as NOV,
        December as DEC,
    };

    match month {
        JAN => println!("It's Winter."),
        FEB => println!("It's Winter."),
        MAR => println!("It's Spring."),
        APR => println!("It's Spring."),
        MAY => println!("It's Spring."),
        JUN => println!("It's Summer."),
        JUL => println!("It's Summer."),
        AUG => println!("It's Summer."),
        SEP => println!("It's Fall."),
        OCT => println!("It's Fall."),
        NOV => println!("It's Fall."),
        DEC => println!("It's Winter."),
        _ => println!("Etc."),
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

In Rust, the `use` keyword is used to bring symbols (types, functions, modules, etc.) into scope, making them accessible without needing to specify their full paths. This helps improve code readability and reduces the need for repetitive typing. Additionally, the `as` keyword can be used to provide an alternative name (an alias) for an imported symbol.

Here's a breakdown of both concepts:

1. **Importing with `use`**:
   The `use` keyword allows you to import symbols from a module, crate, or other scope. It brings the specified symbols into the current scope, making them accessible as if they were defined locally.

   **Syntax**:
   ```rust
   use path::to::module::Symbol;
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```rust
   // Importing the standard library's `String` type
   use std::string::String;

   fn main() {
       let my_string = String::from("Hello, Rust!");
       println!("{}", my_string);
   }
   ```

2. **Renaming with `as`**:
   The `as` keyword allows you to provide an alternative name (alias) for an imported symbol. This can be helpful when symbols have conflicting names or when you want to improve code readability.

   **Syntax**:
   ```rust
   use path::to::module::Symbol as Alias;
   ```

   **Example**:
   ```rust
   // Importing the standard library's `String` type and renaming it as `MyString`
   use std::string::String as MyString;

   fn main() {
       let my_string = MyString::from("Hello, Rust!");
       println!("{}", my_string);
   }
   ```

   **Note**: While renaming with `as` is powerful, it's generally a good practice to use it sparingly and choose meaningful alias names to maintain code clarity.

Using `use` and `as` can significantly improve code readability and organization by reducing the need for fully qualified paths and by avoiding naming conflicts. However, be cautious not to overuse imports or create overly complex alias names, as this could lead to confusion.
