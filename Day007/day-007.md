# Day 7

## Notes

### Macro

A **macro** is like a function that writes code for you, and they all have a `!` after them.

[Incorrect]

```rust
fn main() {    
    let my_number = 100;    
    println("{}", my_number);
}
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=ede0efe576f8403ead80543a7991a1d7)

[Correnct]

```rust
fn main() {    
    let my_number = 100;    
    println!("{}", my_number);
}
```

### Cast (`u8` into `char`)

- **Primitive types**
  - integers
    - Signed integers
      - Posigive `+` and Negative `-` and Zero `0`
      - `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, and `isize`
    - Unsigned integers
      - `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, and `usize`
  - char

`255` is the largest size for a `u8`.

`u8`: `1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 255`

> "Cast `u8` as `char`" means "pretend `u8` is a `char`"
