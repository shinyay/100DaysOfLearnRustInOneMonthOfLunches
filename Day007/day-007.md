# Day 7

## Notes

### Macro

A **macro** is like a function that writes code for you, and they all have a `!` after them.

[Incorrect]

```rust
fn main() {    
    let my_number = 100;    
    println("{}", my_number);
}
```

[Correnct]

```rust
fn main() {    
    let my_number = 100;    
    println!("{}", my_number);
}
```

### Cast (`u8` into `char`)

- **Primitive types**
  - integers
    - Signed integers
      - Posigive `+` and Negative `-` and Zero `0`
    - Unsigned integers
  - char
