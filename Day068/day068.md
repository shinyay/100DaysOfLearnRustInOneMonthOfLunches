## Notes

- [std::rc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/index.html)
  - Single-threaded reference-counting pointers. ‘Rc’ stands for ‘Reference Counted’.

Most values in Rust have a sole owner. Rust uses this ownership system to manage memory.
When a value is stored in memory in Rust, it is stored in a variable. The variable is then considered the owner of the value.
Rust has the concept of scope, and when a variable is out of its scope, it loses its ownership and releases the value it owns from memory.
