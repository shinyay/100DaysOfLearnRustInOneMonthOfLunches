# Day 68

## Notes

- [std::rc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/index.html)
  - Single-threaded reference-counting pointers. ‘Rc’ stands for ‘Reference Counted’.

Most values in Rust have a sole owner. Rust uses this ownership system to manage memory.
When a value is stored in memory in Rust, it is stored in a variable. The variable is then considered the owner of the value.
Rust has the concept of scope, and when a variable is out of its scope, it loses its ownership and releases the value it owns from memory.

However, there are times when this "one owner per value" system is inconvenient.
For example, there are times when you want value A to remain alive until everything that uses it finishes using it.
`Rc<T>`is useful in such cases.
