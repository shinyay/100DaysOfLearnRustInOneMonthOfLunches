# Day 68

## Notes

- [std::rc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/rc/index.html)
  - Single-threaded reference-counting pointers. ‘Rc’ stands for ‘Reference Counted’.

Most values in Rust have a sole owner. Rust uses this ownership system to manage memory.
When a value is stored in memory in Rust, it is stored in a variable. The variable is then considered the owner of the value.
Rust has the concept of scope, and when a variable is out of its scope, it loses its ownership and releases the value it owns from memory.

However, there are times when this "one owner per value" system is inconvenient.
For example, there are times when you want value A to remain alive until everything that uses it finishes using it.
`Rc<T>`is useful in such cases.

### Rc

Rc stands for **"reference counter"**.

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string = "Hello Rc".to_string();
    let cloned_string1 = my_string.clone();
    let cloned_string2 = my_string.clone();

    println!("     my_string: {:p}", &*my_string);
    println!("cloned_string1: {:p}", &*cloned_string1);
    println!("cloned_string2: {:p}", &*cloned_string2);

    println!("------------------------------");

    let my_string: Rc<String> = Rc::new("Hello Rc".to_string());
    let cloned_string1 = my_string.clone();
    let cloned_string2 = my_string.clone();

    println!("     my_string: {:p}", &*my_string);
    println!("cloned_string1: {:p}", &*cloned_string1);
    println!("cloned_string2: {:p}", &*cloned_string2);
}
```

As you can see from the following results, they point to the same instance.

```shell
     my_string: 0x7fe4da804140
cloned_string1: 0x7fe4da804150
cloned_string2: 0x7fe4da804160
------------------------------
     my_string: 0x7fe4da804420
cloned_string1: 0x7fe4da804420
cloned_string2: 0x7fe4da804420
```

#### The usecase of Rc

In Rust, the `Rc` (Reference Counting) is a smart pointer that stands for "reference counting." It's used for managing shared ownership of data among multiple parts of your program. `Rc` enables you to have multiple references to the same data while ensuring that the data is cleaned up automatically when it's no longer needed.

Here's the main use of `Rc`:

1. **Shared Ownership**:
   When you have data that needs to be accessed by multiple parts of your program and you want them to share ownership of that data, you can use `Rc`. Unlike regular references (`&T`), which provide only borrowing without ownership, `Rc` allows multiple instances to "own" the data collectively.

However, there's an important consideration:

- **Single-Threaded Use**:
  `Rc` is designed for single-threaded environments. It's not suitable for concurrent programming where data can be accessed and modified by multiple threads at the same time. If you need shared ownership in a multi-threaded scenario, you should consider using `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting), which provides atomic operations for concurrent access.

Here's a simple example of using `Rc`:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let shared_data = Rc::new("Hello, Rc!".to_string());

    // Create multiple references to the same data
    let reference1 = Rc::clone(&shared_data);
    let reference2 = Rc::clone(&shared_data);

    println!("Reference 1: {}", reference1);
    println!("Reference 2: {}", reference2);
}
```

In this example, `shared_data` is a string that's shared among `reference1` and `reference2` using `Rc::clone()`. The `Rc` keeps track of how many references exist, and when the last reference goes out of scope, the data is automatically deallocated.

Remember that while `Rc` is useful for situations where multiple parts of your code need shared access to data, it's not suitable for multi-threaded scenarios. For concurrent programming, you should use `Arc`, which is an atomic version of `Rc` that provides thread-safe reference counting.

## Key Takeaways

- `Rc` stands for "Reference Counting" and is used for shared ownership of data among multiple parts of a program.
  
- It's a smart pointer in the `std::rc` module, designed for single-threaded scenarios.

- `Rc` keeps track of how many references exist to a piece of data using reference counting.

- When you clone an `Rc`, the reference count increases, and when an `Rc` goes out of scope, the reference count decreases.

- When the reference count drops to zero, the data is deallocated.

- `Rc` allows multiple references to share the same data efficiently, reducing memory usage by avoiding unnecessary copying.

- It's not suitable for multi-threaded scenarios where data can be accessed and modified by multiple threads at once.

- For multi-threaded environments, use `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) for thread-safe shared ownership.

- Cyclic references with `Rc` can lead to memory leaks, so be mindful of avoiding such situations.

- Use `Rc` when you need shared ownership in single-threaded code without the need for mutable access.

- If you require mutable access or work in multi-threaded environments, consider using other smart pointers like `Box`, `Mutex`, `RwLock`, or `Arc` as appropriate.

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    // Creating an Rc with an integer
    let data = Rc::new(42);
    println!("Reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&data)); // Prints 1
    
    // Cloning the Rc, increasing the reference count
    let reference1 = Rc::clone(&data);
    println!("Reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&data)); // Prints 2
    let reference2 = Rc::clone(&data);
    println!("Reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&data)); // Prints 3
       
    // Dropping the references, decreasing the reference count
    drop(reference1);
    println!("Reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&data)); // Prints 2
    
    // Dropping the last reference, deallocating the data
    drop(reference2);
    println!("Reference count: {}", Rc::strong_count(&data)); // Prints 1
    // The data is deallocated here
}
```
