# Day 57

## Notes

### Lifetime annotations

This struct works:

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: String,
    age: u32,
}
 
fn main() {
    let me = Person {
        name: "Yanagihara".to_string(),
        age: 30,
    };

    println!("{:?}", me);
}
```

On the other hand, the following struct does not work.
The only change is that the String type is changed to &str.

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct Person {
    name: &str,
    age: u32,
}
 
fn main() {
    let me = Person {
        name: "Yanagihara",
        age: 30,
    };
}
```

```shell
error[E0106]: missing lifetime specifier
 --> src/main.rs:3:11
  |
3 |     name: &str,
  |           ^ expected named lifetime parameter
```
