> 3 More complex types

Today we begin Chapter 3. I will look at more complex types.

### Collection types - Arrays

```rust
fn main() {
    let months = ["Jan", "Feb", "Mar", "Apr", "May", "Jun", "Jul", "Aug", "Sep", "Oct", "Nov", "Dec"];
    months.some_method();
    println!("{:?}", months);
}
```

The arrray has 12 elements. And this type is `[&str; 12]`.

```text
3 |     months.some_method();
  |            ^^^^^^^^^^^ method not found in `[&str; 12]`
```
