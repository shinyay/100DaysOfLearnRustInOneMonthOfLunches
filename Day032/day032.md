# Day 32

## Notes

**Wasmtune** is a standalone wasm-only optimizing runtime for **WebAssembly** and **WASI**. 

> - [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)
>   - WebAssembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a binary instruction format for a stack-based virtual machine. Wasm is designed as a portable compilation target for programming languages, enabling deployment on the web for client and server applications.

> - [WASI (WebAssembly System Interface)](https://webassembly.org/)
>   - WASI is a modular system interface for WebAssembly.
>   - It's designed by the Wasmtime project that provides access to several operating-system-like features, including files and filesystems, Berkeley sockets, clocks, and random numbers,
