## Notes

### Type aliases

A type alias is a way to create a new name for an existing type. It doesn't create a new type; it simply provides an alternative name that can make your code more readable and maintainable. Type aliases are particularly useful for simplifying long or complex type names and for creating more descriptive names for existing types.

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
type MyCharVec = Vec<char>;

fn main() {
    let mut my_chars: MyCharVec = Vec::new();
    
    my_chars.push(1);
    my_chars.push(2);
    my_chars.push(3);

    println!("MyCharVec: {:?}", my_chars);
}
```
