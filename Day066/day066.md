## Notes

### Type aliases

A type alias is a way to create a new name for an existing type. It doesn't create a new type; it simply provides an alternative name that can make your code more readable and maintainable. Type aliases are particularly useful for simplifying long or complex type names and for creating more descriptive names for existing types.

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
type MyCharVec = Vec<char>;

fn main() {
    let mut my_chars: MyCharVec = Vec::new();
    
    my_chars.push(1);
    my_chars.push(2);
    my_chars.push(3);

    println!("MyCharVec: {:?}", my_chars);
}
```

The code occurs the following mismatched type error.

```shell
error[E0308]: mismatched types
 --> src/main.rs:6:19
  |
6 |     my_chars.push(1);
  |              ---- ^ expected `char`, found `u8`
  |              |
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=0302c9b32876b4f39bb13687fde88025)

No explicit type specification is made for the Vec type. However, we have specified `MyCharVec = Vec<char>` as a type alias.
Therefore, when I try to push a numeric value, I get a type mismatch error.

So the next one works:

```rust
type MyCharVec = Vec<char>;

fn main() {
    let mut my_chars: MyCharVec = Vec::new();
    
    my_chars.push('A');
    my_chars.push('B');
    my_chars.push('C');

    println!("MyCharVec: {:?}", my_chars);
}
```

## Key Takeaways

A type alias is a way to create a new name for an existing type. It doesn't create a new type; it simply provides an alternative name that can make your code more readable and maintainable. Type aliases are particularly useful for simplifying long or complex type names and for creating more descriptive names for existing types.

Here's a brief overview of type aliases in Rust:

1. **Creating Type Aliases**:
   You can create a type alias using the `type` keyword, followed by the alias name and the original type.

   ```rust
   type MyAlias = i32;
   ```

2. **Usage**:
   Once a type alias is created, you can use it just like the original type:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       let x: MyAlias = 42;
       let y: i32 = 10;

       println!("x: {}", x);
       println!("y: {}", y);
   }
   ```

3. **Readability and Abstraction**:
   Type aliases improve code readability and provide a level of abstraction. They're especially helpful when dealing with complex types, making code easier to understand.

   ```rust
   type Point = (f64, f64);
   type Result<T> = std::result::Result<T, String>;
   ```

4. **Compatibility and Interchangeability**:
   Type aliases do not create new types, so they're fully compatible with the original type. You can use the alias interchangeably with the original type.

   ```rust
   type Name = String;
   
   fn print_name(name: Name) {
       println!("Name: {}", name);
   }
   
   fn main() {
       let my_name: Name = "Alice".to_string();
       print_name(my_name);
   }
   ```

Type aliases are a powerful tool for creating more expressive code and simplifying complex type names. They're commonly used for defining custom names for existing types, especially in cases where the original type is unwieldy or when you want to enhance code readability.
