# Day 5

## Notes

### Rust Changelogs - 1.68.0 (9 March, 2023)

The version I was using before I went to `1.70.0` was `1.67.0`, so I would like to see what has been released in the period between updates.

- [Rust Changelogs - 1.68.0 (9 March, 2023)](https://releases.rs/docs/1.68.0/)
- [Announcing Rust 1.68.0](https://blog.rust-lang.org/2023/03/09/Rust-1.68.0.html)

#### Cargo's sparse protocol

The **sparse protocol**, which became the default in 1.70.0, was stabilized in 1.68.0.

- [Stabilize sparse-registry](https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/pull/11224/)

The sparse protocol uses the sparse+ protocol prefix in the registry URL. For example, the sparse index URL for crates.io is sparse+https://index.crates.io/.

The sparse protocol downloads each index file using an individual HTTP request. Since this results in a large number of small HTTP requests, performance is significantly improved with a server that supports pipelining and HTTP/2.
