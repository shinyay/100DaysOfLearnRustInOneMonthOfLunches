# Day 43

## Notes

### All you need are the method signatures

> Just write the function signature when making a trait.

Take a look at the following sample. The functions in Traits don't have the method body.

```rust
struct Animal {
    name: String,
}

trait Human {
    fn talk(&self);

    fn eat(&self);

    fn sleep(&self);
}

impl Human for Animal {
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("{} says Hello", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let yanashin = Animal {
        name: "Yanashin".to_string(),
    };

    yanashin.talk();
    yanashin.eat();
    yanashin.sleep();
}
```

Now you can see the following error:

```shell
error[E0046]: not all trait items implemented, missing: `eat`, `sleep`
  --> src/main.rs:13:1
   |
8  |     fn eat(&self);
   |     -------------- `eat` from trait
9  |
10 |     fn sleep(&self);
   |     ---------------- `sleep` from trait
...
13 | impl Human for Animal {
   | ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^ missing `eat`, `sleep` in implementation
```

As can be seen, the error occurs because the methods are not implemented correctly.

Therefore, I will implement them in an `impl` clause instead of a `trait` clause.

```rust
trait Human {
    fn talk(&self);

    fn eat(&self);

    fn sleep(&self);
}

impl Human for Animal {
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("{} says Hello", self.name);
    }

    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("Yummy");
    }

    fn sleep(&self) {
        println!("Good night");
    }
}
```

It works.

In other words, the implementation of the method body can be in a `trait` clause or in an `impl` clause.
If you want each type to implement common processing, it is better to define the method body in the `trait` clause, and if you want each type to perform different processing, it is better to define the method body in the `impl` clause.
