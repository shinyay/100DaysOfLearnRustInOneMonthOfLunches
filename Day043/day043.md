# Day 43

## Notes

### All you need are the method signatures

> Just write the function signature when making a trait.

Take a look at the following sample. The functions in Traits don't have the method body.

```rust
struct Animal {
    name: String,
}

trait Human {
    fn talk(&self);

    fn eat(&self);

    fn sleep(&self);
}

impl Human for Animal {
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("{} says Hello", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let yanashin = Animal {
        name: "Yanashin".to_string(),
    };

    yanashin.talk();
    yanashin.eat();
    yanashin.sleep();
}
```
