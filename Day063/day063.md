## Notes

### Interior mutability - RwLock

- [std::sync::RwLock](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html)
  - **A reader-writer lock**
  - This type of lock allows a number of readers or at most one writer at any point in time. The write portion of this lock typically allows modification of the underlying data (exclusive access) and the read portion of this lock typically allows for read-only access (shared access).

In the case of `Mutex` when you access the value,

- `.lock().unwrap()`

In the case of `RwLock`, instead of `.lock()`

- `.write().unwrap()`
- `.read().unwrap()`

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;
 
fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(1);
 
    let my_read = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();
    println!("{:?}", my_read);
 
    // This program runs forever withoud `drop()`
    drop(my_read);

    let mut my_write = my_rwlock.write().unwrap();
    *my_write += 1;

    // This program outputs `data: <locked>` forever withoud `drop()`
    drop(my_write);

    println!("{:?}", my_rwlock);
}
```

Just like `Mutex`, you need to use `drop()` for RwLock.

It should be good if you use `try_read()` and `try_write()`

- [pub fn try_read(&self) -> TryLockResult<RwLockReadGuard<'_, T>>](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html#method.try_read)
- [pub fn try_write(&self) -> TryLockResult<RwLockWriteGuard<'_, T>>](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/sync/struct.RwLock.html#method.try_write)
  - Attempts to lock this `RwLock` with exclusive write access.
  - If the lock could not be acquired at this time, then `Err` is returned. Otherwise, an RAII guard is returned which will release the lock when it is dropped.

```rust
use std::sync::RwLock;
 
fn main() {
    let my_rwlock = RwLock::new(1);

    let my_read = my_rwlock.read().unwrap();
    println!("The value from RwLock: {}", my_read);

    drop(my_read);

    if let Ok(mut value) = my_rwlock.try_write() {
        *value += 10;
        println!("The value from RwLock: {}", value);
    } else {
        println!("Can't Get Write Access")
    };
}
```

## Key Takeaways

`RwLock` stands for "reader-writer lock" and is a synchronization primitive that provides interior mutability for shared data while allowing multiple readers or a single writer at the same time. It enables safe concurrent access to data when there are frequent reads and infrequent writes.

The `RwLock` is part of the `std::sync` module in the standard library. Unlike `Mutex`, which allows exclusive access (one writer) at a time, `RwLock` allows concurrent shared access (multiple readers) as long as no writer is active. When a writer is holding the lock, all readers and other writers are blocked until the writer releases the lock.

Key features of `RwLock`:

1. **Interior Mutability**: `RwLock` provides a mechanism for interior mutability, allowing shared data to be modified safely by obtaining a write lock.

2. **`read()` and `write()` Methods**: To access the shared data, you use `read()` for reading (obtaining a read lock) and `write()` for writing (obtaining a write lock). Read locks can be held simultaneously by multiple threads, but write locks are exclusive.

3. **Blocking**: When a thread attempts to acquire a write lock while another thread holds the read or write lock, it is blocked until the lock becomes available.
