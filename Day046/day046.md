# Day 46

## Notes

### Chaining methods

> With an imperative approach, a developer writes code that specifies the steps that the computer must take to accomplish the goal. This is sometimes referred to as algorithmic programming. In contrast, a functional approach involves composing the problem as a set of functions to be executed.

The following style is **Impleratice way**:

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec = Vec::new();
    let mut counter = 1;

    while counter < 10 {
        my_vec.push(counter);
        counter += 1;
    }

    println!("counter:{:?}", my_vec);
}
```
