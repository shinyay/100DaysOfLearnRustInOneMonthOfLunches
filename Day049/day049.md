# Day 49

## Notes

### Underscore symbol |_|` in a Closure

You might have seen `|_|` in a closure.
`|_|` means "Okay, this closure takes arguments, but I won't name it because it doesn't matter."

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 
    println!("{:?}", my_vec.iter().for_each(|| println!("We didn't use the variables at all")));
}
```

```shell
error[E0593]: closure is expected to take 1 argument, but it takes 0 arguments

5 |     println!("{:?}", my_vec.iter().for_each(|| println!("We didn't use the variables at all")));
  |                                    ^^^^^^^^ -- takes 0 arguments
  |                                    |
  |                                    expected closure that takes 1 argument
```

With `|_|` symbol, the closure works.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 
    println!("{:?}", my_vec.iter().for_each(|_| println!("We didn't use the variables at all")));
}
```

## Key Takeaways

Summary for these 5 days:

- Method chaining can be unfamiliar at first, but is so convenient that people tend to use it more and more as they become familiar with Rust
- The core method in iterators is `.next()`, which returns an `Option`. Almost all iterators return `Some` until they run out of items, and after that `None`.
- Iterators are lazy. To use one, call `.next()` or use a method like `.collect()` to turn it into another type (usually a `Vec`).
- You can give a closure a name if you want to use the name to call the closure later. But most of the time you don't give names to closures.
- A closure can capture variables in its scope. You don't need to pass the variables in as arguments - the closure can just grab them.
- An 'associated type' is the type that goes with a trait. Most traits don't have them, but some do.
When you implement a trait with an associated type, you decide what it will be.
