## Notes

### Underscore symbol |_|` in a Closure

You might have seen `|_|` in a closure.
`|_|` means "Okay, this closure takes arguments, but I won't name it because it doesn't matter."

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
 
    println!("{:?}", my_vec.iter().for_each(|| println!("We didn't use the variables at all")));
}
```

```shell
error[E0593]: closure is expected to take 1 argument, but it takes 0 arguments

5 |     println!("{:?}", my_vec.iter().for_each(|| println!("We didn't use the variables at all")));
  |                                    ^^^^^^^^ -- takes 0 arguments
  |                                    |
  |                                    expected closure that takes 1 argument
```
