# Day 88

## Notes

### clap - Command Line Argument Parser for Rust

- [clap](https://docs.rs/clap/latest/clap/)

I made something like a command line the other day in Rust.
By the way, if you actually want to create a command line, there are crates that provide functions to parse arguments and other things used in command lines.
That is `clap`.
Then, I created a simple command using that `clap`.

### Then, I created a simple command using that `clap`

1. Importing `clap`:

   ```rust
   use clap::Parser;
   ```

   This line imports the `Parser` trait from the `clap` crate. The `Parser` trait provides the necessary functionality to parse command-line arguments and options using `clap`.

2. Defining a command-line application:

   ```rust
   #[derive(Parser, Debug)]
   #[command(
       author = "Shinya Yanagihara",
       version = "0.0.1",
       about = "My first cli with clap"
   )]
   struct Args {
       // ...
   }
   ```

   Here, we define a struct named `Args` using a custom derive attribute `Parser`. This custom derive attribute is provided by `clap` and allows you to automatically generate command-line argument parsing code for your struct.

   - `author`, `version`, and `about` are attributes that provide information about your CLI application. These details are typically displayed when a user requests help or version information.

3. Defining command-line arguments:

   ```rust
   /// Name of the person to greet
   #[arg(short, long)]
   name: String,

   /// Number of times to greet
   #[arg(short, long, default_value_t = 1)]
   count: u8,
   ```

   In the `Args` struct, we define two command-line arguments:
   
   - `name`: This argument has both short (`-n`) and long (`--name`) flags. It represents the name of the person to greet and expects a `String` value.
   
   - `count`: This argument has short (`-c`) and long (`--count`) flags. It represents the number of times to greet and has a default value of `1` (specified using `default_value_t`).

4. Parsing command-line arguments:

   ```rust
   fn main() {
       let args = Args::parse();

       for _ in 0..args.count {
           println!("Hello {}!", args.name)
       }
   }
   ```

   In the `main` function, we use `Args::parse()` to parse the command-line arguments. This function is automatically generated for the `Args` struct thanks to the `Parser` trait.

   - We then use the parsed `args` to print a greeting message. It prints the message specified in the `println!` macro, where `{}` is replaced with the value of `args.name`. This greeting is printed `args.count` times.

So, when you run this Rust program and provide command-line arguments, it will greet the specified person the specified number of times. For example:

```sh
$ my_cli_app --name Alice --count 3
Hello Alice!
Hello Alice!
Hello Alice!
```

## Key Takeaways

**`clap` 2.x Series:**

1. Used the "builder" API style, where you manually constructed command-line parsers by chaining methods on various builder objects.

2. Explicitly defined every aspect of the CLI app, including commands, subcommands, arguments, and options.

3. Required extensive boilerplate code for argument parsing and validation.

4. Used a procedural macro to generate code based on the builder API configuration.

5. More verbose and less declarative in nature.

**`clap` 4.x Series:**

1. Introduces the "derive" API style, allowing you to define CLI structures using custom derives, reducing the need for manual configuration.

2. Emphasizes a declarative approach, where you define the structure of your CLI app using Rust structs and attributes.

3. Automatically derives argument parsing and validation code from the struct definition, reducing boilerplate.

4. Utilizes procedural macros to generate code based on struct attributes and derive macros.

5. More concise and expressive, as much of the parsing logic is generated automatically.

Key Takeaways:

- `clap` 4.x simplifies the process of defining and parsing command-line interfaces by using Rust's derive macros to generate much of the code.

- The "derive" API provides a more concise and declarative way to define CLI structures, making it easier to focus on the core functionality of your app.

- `clap` 4.x encourages a more Rustic and ergonomic approach to building command-line applications.

- While `clap` 4.x offers many advantages, there might be some learning curve involved, especially when transitioning from `clap` 2.x or when searching for examples in the documentation.

Overall, `clap` 4.x represents a modern and more user-friendly way to work with command-line interfaces in Rust, reducing boilerplate code and making CLI development more accessible and maintainable.
