## Notes

### Traits: The basics

Examples of traits already mentioned:

- `Debug`
- `Copy`
- `Clone`

**Type X** implements **Trait Y** means:

- **Trait Y** has some methods
- **Type X** can uses **Trait Y**'s methods

In the case of `Debug`, there are attributes that are automatically implemented:

- `#[derive(Debug)]`

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStruct {
    number: i32,
}
 
fn main() {}
```

Usually, however, a trait must be defined and declared to be implemented.
Take a look at the following sample. It has:

- `Animal` struct
- `Human` trait
  - `Human` has 3 methods

- **Type X** implements **Trait Y**
- `Animal` implements `Human` trait
  - "`Animal` implements `Human` trait" declares its own method, `talk`. However, it is declared as the same signature and overridden.

```rust
struct Animal {
    name: String,
}

trait Human {
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("Hello");
    }

    fn eat(&self) {
        println!("Yummy");
    }

    fn sleep(&self) {
        println!("Good night");
    }
}

impl Human for Animal {
    fn talk(&self) {
        println!("{} says Hello", self.name);
    }
}

fn main() {
    let yanashin = Animal {
        name: "Yanashin".to_string(),
    };

    yanashin.talk();
    yanashin.eat();
    yanashin.sleep();
}
```
