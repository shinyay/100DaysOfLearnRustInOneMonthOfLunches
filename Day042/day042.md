## Notes

### Traits: The basics

Examples of traits already mentioned:

- `Debug`
- `Copy`
- `Clone`

**Type X** implements **Trait Y** means:

- **Trait Y** has some methods
- **Type X** can uses **Trait Y**'s methods

In the case of `Debug`, there are attributes that are automatically implemented:

- `#[derive(Debug)]`

```rust
#[derive(Debug)]
struct MyStruct {
    number: i32,
}
 
fn main() {}
```
