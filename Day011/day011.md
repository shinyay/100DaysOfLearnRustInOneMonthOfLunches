# Day 11

## Notes

### The stack, the heap, and pointers

- **Stack**:
  - very fast
  - Something like the stack of dishes
  - The stack needs to know the exact size
    - If you don't know tha size, you can put the data in the **heap**

- **Heap**
  - Heap can have any size of data
    - The program asks the computer for apiece of memory to put the data in
    - To find the heap, a **pointer** goes  on the stack

- **Pointer**
  - The pointer in Rust is called **Reference**
  - n Rust, references have a `&`

```rust
let my_variable =1;
let my_reference = &my_variable;
// my_reference refers to my_variable
```

### Strings

Rust has the following two types of strings:

- `String`
- `&str`

#### &str

It is a simple string.
`&str` is **a pointer** to the data plus **the length**.


#### String
