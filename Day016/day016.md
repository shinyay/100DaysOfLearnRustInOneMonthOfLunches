# Day 16

## Notes

### Variables without values

Rust will not compile if there are uninitialized variables.

```rust
fn main() {
    let not_initialized_variable;
}
```

- There is a code block and the value of the variable is inside it
- Variables need to be placed outside of the code block

```rust
fn main() {
    let not_initialized_variable;
    {
        not_initialized_variable = 16;
        println!("{not_initialized_variable}");
    }
}
```

Take a look at the following sample:

```rust
fn main() {
    let tommorow;
    {
        let today = {
            16
        };
        tommorow = count_plus(today);
        println!("{tommorow}");
    }
    println!("{tommorow}");
}

fn count_plus(day: i32) -> i32 {
    day + 1
}
```

## Key Takeaways

Today I looked at handling uninitialized variables.
