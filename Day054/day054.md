# Day 54

## Notes

### Methods for closures and iterators (Cycling, zipping, folding)

- [pub fn chunks(&self, chunk_size: usize) -> Chunks<'_, T>](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/primitive.slice.html#method.chunks)
  - Returns an iterator over chunk_size elements of the slice at a time, starting at the beginning of the slice.
  - The chunks are slices and do not overlap. If chunk_size does not divide the length of the slice, then the last chunk will not have length chunk_size.
