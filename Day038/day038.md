## Notes

### BinaryHeap

`BinaryHeap` is called as **Priority Queue**. It keeps the largest item in the front, but the other items are in any order.

See the following samlpe.

```rust
use std::collections::BinaryHeap;
 
fn show_queue(input: &BinaryHeap<i32>) -> Vec<i32> {
    let mut elements_vec = vec![];

    for number in input {
        elements_vec.push(*number)
    }
    elements_vec
}
 
fn main() {
    let my_numbers = vec![1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89];
 
    let mut my_bheap = BinaryHeap::new();
 
    for number in my_numbers {
        my_bheap.push(number);
    }
 
    while let Some(number) = my_bheap.pop() {
        println!("Popped off {number}. Nmbers are: {:?}", show_queue(&my_bheap));
    }
}
```

```shell
Popped off 89. Nmbers are: [55, 34, 13, 21, 3, 2, 8, 1, 5]
Popped off 55. Nmbers are: [34, 21, 13, 5, 3, 2, 8, 1]
Popped off 34. Nmbers are: [21, 5, 13, 1, 3, 2, 8]
Popped off 21. Nmbers are: [13, 5, 8, 1, 3, 2]
Popped off 13. Nmbers are: [8, 5, 2, 1, 3]
Popped off 8. Nmbers are: [5, 3, 2, 1]
Popped off 5. Nmbers are: [3, 1, 2]
Popped off 3. Nmbers are: [2, 1]
Popped off 2. Nmbers are: [1]
Popped off 1. Nmbers are: []
