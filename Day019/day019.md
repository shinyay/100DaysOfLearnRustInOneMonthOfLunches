## Notes

### Collection types - Vectors

The **Vector type** is written `Vec`

- **Vectors**: You can change their size
- **Array**: You cannot dynamically resize the array

```rust
fn main() {
    let week1 = String::from("Monday");
    let week2 = String::from("Tuesday");
    let week3 = String::from("Wednesday");
    
    let mut my_vec = Vec::new();
    
    my_vec.push(week1);
    my_vec.push(week2);
    my_vec.push(week3);
    
    println!("{my_vec:?}");
}
```

The Vector mentioned earlier owned only strings as elements. Therefore, the specific type is as follows

- `Vec<String>`
