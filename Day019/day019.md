## Notes

### Collection types - Vectors

The **Vector type** is written `Vec`

- **Vectors**: You can change their size
- **Array**: You cannot dynamically resize the array

```rust
fn main() {
    let week1 = String::from("Monday");
    let week2 = String::from("Tuesday");
    let week3 = String::from("Wednesday");
    
    let mut my_vec = Vec::new();
    
    my_vec.push(week1);
    my_vec.push(week2);
    my_vec.push(week3);
    
    println!("{my_vec:?}");
}
```

- [Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/?version=stable&mode=debug&edition=2021&gist=117b2a7f235eb1ebec498ef940ded043)

The Vector mentioned earlier owned only strings as elements. Therefore, the specific type is as follows

- `Vec<String>`

Angle brackets `<>` are used to represent the type of the element inside the Vector.

The following declaration shows `Vec` that has `Vec` of `String`.

- `Vec<Vec<String>>`

The following declaration shows each item is a tuple.

- `Vec<(i32, i32)>`

#### vec! macro

You can declaer Vec with `vec!` macro, like arrays.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec = vec![1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10];
    
    println!("{my_vec:?}");
}
```
