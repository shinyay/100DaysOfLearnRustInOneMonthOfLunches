# Day 1

## Notes

### Rust Editor

- [Rust Playground](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-playground)

1. A nice, unobtrusive editor with syntax highlighting
2. The ability to compile in debug or release mode against the current stable, beta, or nightly version of Rust
3. The top 100 popular crates (ranked by all-time downloads), crates that are part of the Rust Cookbook and all of their dependencies are available for use
4. The ability to quickly load and save your code to a GitHub Gist and share it with your friends.
5. `rustfmt` and `Clippy` can be run against the source code
6. The ability to see the LLVM IR, assembly, or Rust MIR for the source code.

- [Hosted Rust Playground](https://play.rust-lang.org/)

### The first Rust code on Playgrould

The following code is incorrect.

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_name: String = "Dave";
    my_name.push("!");
    println!("{}" my_name);
}
```

#### Error and Fix

```

  |                   ^^^^^^^ expected `,`
```

```rust
    println!("{}", my_name);
```

```
