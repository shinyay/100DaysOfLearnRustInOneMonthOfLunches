# Day 25

## Notes

### Enums

`enum` looks similar to `struct`. The following is the difference:

- `struct`: you want one thing **AND** another thing
  - structs are for many things together
- `enum`: you want one thing **OR** another thing
  - enums are for many possible choices

```rust
enum DayOfWeek {
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday,
}

fn what_is_today(today: &DayOfWeek) -> &str{
    let now = match today {
        DayOfWeek::Monday => "Weekday",
        DayOfWeek::Tuesday => "Weekday",
        DayOfWeek::Wednesday => "Weekday",
        DayOfWeek::Thursday => "Weekday",
        DayOfWeek::Friday => "Weekday",
        DayOfWeek::Saturday => "Weekend",
        DayOfWeek::Sunday => "Weekend",
    };
    now
}

fn main() {
    let today = DayOfWeek::Sunday;
    let now = what_is_today(&today);
    println!("{now}");
}
```

You can see the following warning:

```text
warning: variants `Monday`, `Tuesday`, `Wednesday`, `Thursday`, `Friday`, and `Saturday` are never constructed
```

You can declare many possible choices, and the each one is called `variant`.

```rust
enum DayOfWeek {
    Monday,
    Tuesday,
    Wednesday,
    Thursday,
    Friday,
    Saturday,
    Sunday,
}

fn main() {
    use DayOfWeek::*;
    let weekdays = vec![Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday];
    for weekday in weekdays {
        println!("{}", weekday as i32);
    }
}
```

## Key Takeaways

The difference between enums and structs:

- structs are for many things together
- enums are for many possible choices
