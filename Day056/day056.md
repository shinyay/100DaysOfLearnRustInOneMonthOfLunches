## Notes

### Static lifetime

- `&'static str`
  - [Static](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/scope/lifetime/static_lifetime.html)
  - [&'static and T: 'static](https://practice.rs/lifetime/static.html)

Rust has several reserved lifetime names.
One of them is `'static`

The following sample is a reference with `'static` lifetime:
  - `'`: lifetime
  - `static`:  string literals have a lifetime called `static`

```rust
let s: &'static str = "hello world";
```
