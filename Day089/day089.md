### Getting started with RustRover

Today I got an announcement of the new Rust IDE by JetBrains, which is **RustRover**.

I checked JetBrains Toolbox and **RustRover 2023.2 EAP** is already listed, so I will try to install it as soon as possible.

#### 1. Open RustRover

The familiar intellij-like initial screen appears.

Now then I create a new project.

#### First coding

When you specify the name of **crate**, RustRover shows the candidate versions.

Ofcourse you can use git on RustRover easily.

And of course, code completion is performed.

You can also run code on RustRover, use the debugger, and more.

## Key Takeaways

JetBrains is introducing RustRover, a dedicated standalone integrated development environment (IDE) for Rust programming. This IDE comes as a response to the demand from the Rust community for a specialized IDE that offers features comparable to other JetBrains IDEs. JetBrains has initiated the RustRover Early Access Program (EAP) to allow users to try the IDE, provide feedback, and contribute to its development. RustRover will be available for free during its public preview phase, and its licensing model will be finalized closer to the commercial release date.

1. **Introduction of RustRover:** JetBrains has released RustRover, an independent IDE tailored specifically for the Rust programming language.
