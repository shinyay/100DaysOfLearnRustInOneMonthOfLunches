### Getting started with RustRover

Today I got an announcement of the new Rust IDE by JetBrains, which is **RustRover**.

I checked JetBrains Toolbox and **RustRover 2023.2 EAP** is already listed, so I will try to install it as soon as possible.

#### 1. Open RustRover

The familiar intellij-like initial screen appears.

Now then I create a new project.

#### First coding

When you specify the name of **crate**, RustRover shows the candidate versions.

Ofcourse you can use git on RustRover easily.

And of course, code completion is performed.

You can also run code on RustRover, use the debugger, and more.

## Key Takeaways

JetBrains is introducing RustRover, a dedicated standalone integrated development environment (IDE) for Rust programming. This IDE comes as a response to the demand from the Rust community for a specialized IDE that offers features comparable to other JetBrains IDEs. JetBrains has initiated the RustRover Early Access Program (EAP) to allow users to try the IDE, provide feedback, and contribute to its development. RustRover will be available for free during its public preview phase, and its licensing model will be finalized closer to the commercial release date.

1. **Introduction of RustRover:** JetBrains has released RustRover, an independent IDE tailored specifically for the Rust programming language.

2. **Rust Support History:** JetBrains has been working for years to integrate Rust support as a plugin for both IntelliJ IDEA and CLion. However, the demand for a dedicated Rust IDE with features akin to other JetBrains IDEs has been persistent in the community.

3. **RustRover Early Access Program (EAP):** The RustRover EAP is open for users to join. JetBrains encourages users to test RustRover, provide feedback, and actively participate in shaping the product's development. Frequent updates will be made based on user input. During the public preview, RustRover is offered for free, with the licensing model to be established before the commercial release.

4. **Commercial IDE:** RustRover will transition to a commercial plan after the EAP period. The decision to move to a commercial model is driven by the increasing demands for new functionality within RustRover. JetBrains aims to elevate Rust support to new heights.

5. **Release Date:** JetBrains plans to release RustRover before September 2024.

6. **Existing Open-Source Plugin:** The existing open-source Rust plugin, which served as the foundation for RustRover, will remain open source and accessible on GitHub and marketplaces. However, ongoing development efforts will be concentrated on RustRover, which is closed source. JetBrains will attempt to maintain compatibility with newer IDE versions but won't actively fix bugs or add features to the open-source plugin.
