## Notes

### Arc and Rc

`Arc` and `Rc` are both smart pointers in Rust that enable shared ownership of data. However, they differ in their use cases and how they handle multi-threading. Let's explore the features and differences between them:

**Shared Ownership:**

- **`Rc` (Reference Counting):** `Rc` is used for shared ownership within a single thread. It keeps track of the number of references to a value and deallocates the value when the reference count drops to zero. It's lightweight and doesn't guarantee thread safety.

- **`Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting):** `Arc` is designed for shared ownership across multiple threads. It provides the same functionality as `Rc`, but with the added guarantee of thread safety. It uses atomic operations to manage the reference count, ensuring that multiple threads can safely access the shared data.

**Thread Safety:**

- **`Rc`:** Since `Rc` is not thread-safe, it cannot be shared among multiple threads safely. It's suitable for scenarios where shared ownership is needed within a single thread or when combined with other synchronization mechanisms.

- **`Arc`:** `Arc` is specifically designed to be used in multi-threaded scenarios. It ensures that data can be safely shared among multiple threads without causing data races or synchronization issues.

**Performance and Overhead:**

- **`Rc`:** `Rc` is generally lighter in terms of memory overhead and performs better in single-threaded scenarios due to its lack of atomic operations. It's well-suited for scenarios where multi-threading is not a requirement.

- **`Arc`:** `Arc` has a bit more memory overhead and involves atomic operations for reference counting, which can have a performance cost. However, this overhead ensures thread safety, making it suitable for multi-threaded applications.

**Use Cases:**

- **`Rc`:** Use `Rc` when you need shared ownership within a single thread and don't require multi-threading. It's often used for scenarios like sharing data between parts of a single-threaded application.

- **`Arc`:** Use `Arc` when you need shared ownership across multiple threads. It's useful for concurrent and parallel programming, where you want to share data safely and efficiently among different threads.

**Example:**

Here's a simplified example to illustrate the difference:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;
use std::sync::Arc;
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    // Using Rc for shared ownership within a single thread
    let data_rc = Rc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    let rc_clone = data_rc.clone();
    
    // Using Arc for shared ownership across multiple threads
    let data_arc = Arc::new(vec![1, 2, 3]);
    let arc_clone = Arc::clone(&data_arc);

    // Spawning a thread to access data_arc
    let thread_arc = thread::spawn(move || {
        println!("Thread: {:?}", data_arc);
    });

    // Wait for the thread to finish
    thread_arc.join().unwrap();
}
```

In this example, `Rc` is used for shared ownership within the same thread (`data_rc` and `rc_clone`), while `Arc` is used for shared ownership across threads (`data_arc` and `arc_clone`).

In summary, both `Arc` and `Rc` provide shared ownership, but `Arc` is suitable for multi-threading scenarios due to its thread safety, while `Rc` is designed for single-threaded use. The choice between them depends on whether you need to share data between threads or within a single thread.
