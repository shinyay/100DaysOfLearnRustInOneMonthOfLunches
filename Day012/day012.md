# Day 12

## Notes

### Strings

`&str` has the `&` in front of it because you need a reference to use a `str`.

- `&str`
  - **Stack**: Stack must know the size.
  - **&**: `&` tells the compiler the size.

The main method of converting `&str` to `String`

- `"str".to_string()`
  - Methods indirectly implemented by str according to the std::string::ToString trace
- `"str".to_owned()`
  - Methods implemented by str according to the std::borrowed::ToOwned trace
- `String::from("str")`
  - Function implemented by String according to std::convert::From<T> Trait
  - The advantage over the method is that it can be used like str_iter.map(String::from)
- `"str".into()`
  - Methods indirectly implemented by &str according to std::convert::Into<T> Trait
  - The return type of into() must be inferred as String, otherwise an error will occur, limiting its use
- `format!()`
  - Macro

This a sample code:

### Const and Static

3 types of the value declaration:

- `let`
- `const`
  - const is for values that don't change, and are created at compile time.
- `static`
