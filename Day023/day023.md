## Notes

### Structs

> Group things together to build your own types

With structs, you can create your own type.

There are three types of structs:

- **unit struct**
- **tuple struct**, or *unnamed*
- **named struct**

#### Unit Struct

Unit means "doesn't have anything" (like the unit type)

```rust
struct FileDirectory;
 
fn main() {}
```

#### Tuple Struct

All you have to do is to write the **types** inside the tuple, *not the field names*

```rust
struct ColourRgb(u8, u8, u8);
 
fn main() {
    let my_color = ColourRgb(0, 100, 255);
    println!("The second part of the color is: {}", my_color.1);
}
```

### Named Struct

You declare field **names** and **types** inside a `{}` code block. 

```rust
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    price: i32,
}

fn main() {
    let my_book = Book{
        title: "Hello Rust".to_string(),
        author: String::from("Shinya"),
        price: 1000
    };
    
    println!("{}", my_book.title);
    println!("{}", my_book.author);
    println!("{}", my_book.price);
}
```

And also you can declare like the following:

```rust
struct Book {
    title: String,
    author: String,
    price: i32,
}

fn main() {

    let title = "Hello Rust".to_string();
    let author = String::from("Shinya");
    let price = 1000;
    
    let my_book = Book{
        title,
        author,
        price,
    };
    
    println!("{}", my_book.title);
    println!("{}", my_book.author);
    println!("{}", my_book.price);
}
```

If the variables contained in the struct are declared beforehand, there is no need to declare them in the strstruct block.
