## Notes

### Structs

> Group things together to build your own types

With structs, you can create your own type.

There are three types of structs:

- **unit struct**
- **tuple struct**, or *unnamed*
- **named struct**

#### Unit Struct

Unit means "doesn't have anything" (like the unit type)

```rust
struct FileDirectory;
 
fn main() {}
```
