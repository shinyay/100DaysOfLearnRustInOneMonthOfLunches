# Day 69

## Notes

Rust, like most programming languages, uses threads provided by the operating system for concurrency
Rust is unique in that it provides features related to thread creation, synchronization, and concurrency management, while having a strict type system related to thread-safety and race condition avoidance.

### Multiple threads

An OS thread is created using the `std::thread` module; a new thread is created by calling the `std::thread::spawn()` function, and the specified closure (function) is executed within that thread.

- [std::thread::spawn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html)
  - Spawns a new thread, returning a `JoinHandle` for it.

```rust
pub fn spawn<F, T>(f: F) -> JoinHandle<T>
where
    F: FnOnce() -> T + Send + 'static,
    T: Send + 'static,
```

Run the follwing sample. The result changes each time it is executed. That is because `main()` finished before the thread finishes.

```rust
fn main() {
    for count in 1..10 {
        std::thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("[{count}] Hello, world!");
        });
    }
}
```

The `std::thread::spawn` function returs `JoinHandle`, which is an owned permission to join on a thread.

```rust
fn main() {
    for count in 1..10 {
        let my_hundle = std::thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("[{}] Hello, thread!", count)
        });

        my_hundle.join();
    }
}
```

```shell
[1] Hello, thread!
[2] Hello, thread!
[3] Hello, thread!
[4] Hello, thread!
[5] Hello, thread!
[6] Hello, thread!
[7] Hello, thread!
[8] Hello, thread!
[9] Hello, thread!
```

Let's take a look at `join` function:

- [pub fn join(self) -> Result<T>](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/struct.JoinHandle.html#method.join)
  - Waits for the associated thread to finish. This function will return immediately if the associated thread has already finished.

So I just added `my_hundle.join();`, which means "wait until all the threads are done".

By the way, there is one keyword you may not be familiar with. It is `move`. Let's see what happens when you run without this `move`.

```rust
fn main() {
    for count in 1..10 {
        let my_hundle = std::thread::spawn(|| {
            println!("[{}] Hello, thread!", count)
        });

        my_hundle.join();
    }
}
```

```shell
error[E0373]: closure may outlive the current function, but it borrows `count`, which is owned by the current function

  |                                            ^^ may outlive borrowed value `count`
4 |             println!("[{}] Hello, thread!", count)
  |                                             ----- `count` is borrowed here
  |

5 | |         });
  | |__________^
help: to force the closure to take ownership of `count` (and any other referenced variables), use the `move` keyword
  |
3 |         let my_hundle = std::thread::spawn(move || {
  |
```

Closures capture variables outside of functions, but by default they are captured by reference when they are captured.
The `move || {}` syntax allows this to be captured by ownership.

```rust
fn main() {
    let mut my_vec = vec![];
    for count in 0..10 {
        my_vec.push(
          std::thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("[{}] Hello, thread!", count);
          })  
        );
    }

    for handle in my_vec {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }
}
```

### Multithreading facilitated by the `std::thread::spawn`

In Rust, multithreading is facilitated by the `std::thread::spawn` function, which allows you to create new threads that run concurrently with the main thread. This module is part of the standard library (`std::thread`). Multithreading is a powerful way to leverage modern processors with multiple cores to perform tasks concurrently, potentially improving the performance of your program.

Here's how you can use `std::thread::spawn`:

1. **Import the `std::thread` Module**:
   Before using the `spawn` function, you need to import the `std::thread` module.

   ```rust
   use std::thread;
   ```

2. **Using `spawn` to Create a New Thread**:
   The `spawn` function takes a closure (an anonymous function) that contains the code you want to run in the new thread.

   ```rust
   use std::thread;

   fn main() {
       // Spawning a new thread
       let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
           println!("Hello from the new thread!");
       });

       // The main thread continues executing
       println!("Hello from the main thread!");

       // Wait for the spawned thread to finish
       handle.join().unwrap();
   }
   ```

   In this example, a new thread is spawned to print a message. The main thread and the new thread run concurrently.

3. **`join` to Wait for Thread Completion**:
   After spawning a thread, you can use the `join` method on the returned handle to wait for the thread to finish its execution.

4. **Sharing Data Between Threads**:
   If you need to share data between threads, Rust's ownership and borrowing rules ensure that data races are prevented. You can use mechanisms like `Arc` and `Mutex` for thread-safe shared ownership.

Keep in mind that while multithreading can provide performance benefits, it also introduces complexities like synchronization and potential race conditions. Careful design and consideration of Rust's concurrency primitives are essential to avoid bugs and ensure thread safety.

Additionally, Rust's ownership system enforces certain rules and safety mechanisms for concurrent programming that prevent many common threading pitfalls, making it easier to write safe concurrent code compared to languages without such safeguards.

## Key Takeaways

- **Concurrency with `std::thread::spawn`**:
  Rust's `std::thread::spawn` function allows you to create new threads that run concurrently with the main thread. This enables you to take advantage of multiple processor cores to perform tasks simultaneously, potentially improving program performance.

- **Import `std::thread` Module**:
  Before using `spawn`, import the `std::thread` module:

  ```rust
  use std::thread;
  ```

- **Spawn a New Thread**:
  Use `spawn` to create a new thread by passing a closure (an anonymous function) containing the code you want to run concurrently:

  ```rust
  let handle = thread::spawn(|| {
      // Code to run in the new thread
  });
  ```

- **Main Thread Continues Execution**:
  The main thread and the new thread run concurrently, meaning they execute independently of each other.

- **Joining Threads**:
  After spawning a thread, use the `join` method on the returned handle to wait for the thread to complete its execution:

  ```rust
  handle.join().unwrap();
  ```

- **Sharing Data**:
  Rust's ownership and borrowing rules ensure data safety between threads. For thread-safe shared ownership, use mechanisms like `Arc` (Atomic Reference Counting) and synchronization primitives like `Mutex` and `RwLock`.

- **Safety and Concurrency**:
  Rust's ownership system enforces safety rules for concurrency, preventing common threading pitfalls and data races. This makes it easier to write safe concurrent code compared to languages without these safeguards.
