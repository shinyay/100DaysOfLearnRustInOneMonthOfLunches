# Day 69

## Notes

Rust, like most programming languages, uses threads provided by the operating system for concurrency
Rust is unique in that it provides features related to thread creation, synchronization, and concurrency management, while having a strict type system related to thread-safety and race condition avoidance.

### Multiple threads

An OS thread is created using the `std::thread` module; a new thread is created by calling the `std::thread::spawn()` function, and the specified closure (function) is executed within that thread.

- [std::thread::spawn](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/thread/fn.spawn.html)

Run the follwing sample. The result changes each time it is executed. That is because `main()` finished before the thread finishes.

```rust
fn main() {
    for count in 1..10 {
        std::thread::spawn(move || {
            println!("[{count}] Hello, world!");
        });
    }
}
```
