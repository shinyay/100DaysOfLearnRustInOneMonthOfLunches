## Notes

Iterators and closures in Rust have many methods.
Now I can take a look at them.

### Methods for closures and iterators

> The most common reason for using an iterator is probably mapping and filtering. 

- `.filter()`: You can keep the items in an iterator that you want to keep
  - [trait.Iterator.html#method.filter](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/iter/trait.Iterator.html#method.filter)

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_vec = vec!["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"];
 
    let filtered_months = my_vec
                            .into_iter()
                            .filter(|month| month.len() > 5)
                            .filter(|month| month.contains("er"))
                            .collect::<Vec<&str>>();
 
    println!("{:?}", filtered_months);
}
```
