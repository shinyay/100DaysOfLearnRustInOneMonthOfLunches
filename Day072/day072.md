## Notes

### Closures are all unique

> One interesting fact about closures is that one closure can never be the same type as another closure, even if the signatures are the same.
> This is because `Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce` are traits, not concrete types.

Absolutely, you've highlighted a fundamental aspect of closures in Rust. Unlike functions, closures don't have a fixed, concrete type, even if their signatures are identical. This is because closures are implemented as instances of trait objects (`Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`), which are dynamic and don't have a single, specific type.

Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Trait Objects**:
   In Rust, a trait object is a way to work with values of different types that implement a specific trait. Trait objects are essentially pointers to data along with a vtable (virtual function table) that allows dynamic dispatch of trait methods. This enables treating different types implementing the same trait as interchangeable.

2. **Closures as Trait Objects**:
   Closures, as you rightly mentioned, are implemented as instances of traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`). This means that every closure has its own unique type that implements one of these traits.

3. **Type Erasure and Dynamic Dispatch**:
   When you assign a closure to a variable or pass it as an argument, Rust performs a process called type erasure. This means the actual concrete type of the closure is "erased" and replaced with a trait object. This allows you to have different closures with the same signature stored in a way that they can be used interchangeably.

4. **Trait Objects for Closures**:
   For closures, type erasure is particularly important. It means you can create a vector, array, or other data structure that holds different closures with the same signature but possibly different implementations.

   ```rust
   let closures: Vec<Box<dyn Fn(i32) -> i32>> = vec![
       Box::new(|x| x * 2),
       Box::new(|x| x + 10),
   ];

   for closure in &closures {
       println!("{}", closure(5));
   }
   ```

   In this example, both closures have the same signature `Fn(i32) -> i32`, but they are still distinct instances of the `Fn` trait.

5. **No Single Concrete Type**:
   Due to type erasure and the use of trait objects, there's no single concrete type that encompasses all closures with the same signature. This dynamic nature of closures allows for flexibility and composability in Rust's type system.

In summary, closures in Rust are represented as trait objects (`Fn`, `FnMut`, and `FnOnce`). This design provides flexibility and allows closures with the same signature to be treated interchangeably, even though they have different concrete types. It's a powerful aspect of Rust's type system that facilitates generic programming and dynamic dispatch while ensuring type safety.

## Key Takeaways

- **Dynamic Trait Objects**: Closures in Rust are implemented as instances of traits (`Fn`, `FnMut`, `FnOnce`) rather than having fixed concrete types.
  
- **Trait Objects**: Trait objects are pointers to data with associated trait methods, allowing different types to be treated interchangeably based on a shared trait.

- **Type Erasure**: When you use closures, Rust performs type erasure, replacing concrete closure types with trait objects, enabling storage of closures with the same signature but different implementations.

- **Unique Types**: Even if closures have identical signatures, they have distinct types due to being trait objects, ensuring type safety and allowing for dynamic dispatch.

- **Trait Flexibility**: Closures can be used as trait objects, providing composability and flexibility, such as storing different closures in the same collection.

- **No Universal Concrete Type**: There is no single concrete type that encompasses all closures with the same signature; instead, they are represented by their respective trait object types.

This trait-based approach to closures contributes to Rust's expressive and type-safe system, enabling powerful features like dynamic dispatch and the ability to work with closures in a flexible and interchangeable manner.
