## Notes

### Scoped threads

**Scoped threads** are a new feature of Rust that makes multithreading and concurrency easier and safer.

Previously, the `crossbeam` crate provided a way to create scoped threads. However, that scoped thread function is now soft deprecated in favor of Rust's built-in scoped thread function.

#### Scope in Rust

A scope is a block of code contained within a block of code; the Rust compiler restricts access to variables and constants within a scope to lines and other scopes within that scope.

Depending on the programming language, scopes are usually associated with function definitions, conditional definitions, loop definitions, and selection definitions.

#### std::thread::scope

Threads provide a way to achieve concurrency in a Rust project. Scoped threads are regular threads that exist and run in a monitored context. A scope is an environment that allows you to easily manage many threads in your code.

To construct a scope, use the `std::thread::scope` function and pass a closure.

```rust
std::thread::scope(|scope| { });
```
